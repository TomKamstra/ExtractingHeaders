Abstract  – This paper presents a bearing fault detection method for permanent magnet synchronous 
motors (PMSMs). Owing to its good characteris tics, PMSM usage has increased; however, a 
substantial number of motor failures are also reported. Many studies have focused on bearing fault detection using vibration sensors. However, current sensors are already installed in many industries, and therefore, if bearing faults can be detected using these sensors, there would be no need to install additional sensors. A frequency analysis is perfor med to detect bearing faults and fast Fourier 
transform (FFT)-based methods can be used for the same. FFT needs to have a high resolution to be able to differentiate between the frequencies of be aring faults from those of the stator current. 
However, FFT requires extensive data and high co mputational cost to achieve this high resolution. 
Therefore, the zoom FFT (ZFFT) algorithm is impl emented to minimize the computational cost and to 
increase the resolution. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing FFT and ZFFT waveforms.

1. Introduction 
 
Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) are 
used in a variety of applicatio ns. Fig. 1 shows a generalized 
structure of an IPMSM. Becaus e the rotor of the PMSM is 
a permanent magnet, it does not require an external power 
source to generate the flux. This helps minimize power consumption and improve system efficiency [1, 2]. Thus, PMSMs compare well to other motors. As PMSM usage increases, motor failures are also expected. Accordingly, several researchers have conducted motor reliability studies. The results of severa l studies show that bearing 
faults cause more than 40% of all machine failures [3]. Thus, it is critical to monitor the condition of bearings in electrical machines. 
In many studies, a popular approach has been to measure 
bearing condition using a vibration sensor. This is because bearing faults cause radial movement between the stator and rotor, and bearing fault characteristics are reflected in the machine vibration [4]. Ho wever, an accelerometer or 
vibration velocity transducer has to be attached to the bearing or bearing support housing directly. Further, additional system cost is incurred because of the additional vibration sensor. 
As a result, monitoring bearing condition through the 
stator current has been studied for many decades. Many researchers have determined that motor vibration frequencies are reflected in the stator current [5-7]. Therefore, monitoring 
the stator current provides information about bearing faults. In general, current sensors are already installed in many industries and therefore, there is no need to install additional sensors to monitor the stator current. Thus, monitoring the stator current to detect bearing faults provides economic and implementation benefits. 
Frequency analysis of the stator current has to be 
performed to detect frequencies through bearing faults. The traditional frequency analysis method is the fast Fourier transform(FFT). The FFT can provide frequency information via a simplified Fourier transform algorithm. However, there are several frequencies in  the stator current and it is 
difficult to differentiate between these frequencies and those of the bearing faults [8]. Thus, it is necessary to increase the resolution of the FFT to detect the bearing 
fault frequencies. Because the resolution of the FFT 
depends on the sampling frequency, when the number of

amount of data and high computational costs to increase the resolution. However, it is not always possible to satisfy the requirement of extensive data because of hardware limitations. 
The short time Fourier transform (STFT) can be used 
to achieve robustness and simplicity to overcome the limitations of the FFT [9]. However, the STFT is dependent on the type and the length of the window, and therefore, a tradeoff between time and frequency resolution is needed. 
In fact, because the frequency of the bearing fault is 
present in specific frequency bins, and the high frequency resolution and narrow frequency band are needed, it is more efficient to expand the frequency region of interest. Therefore, the zoom FFT (Z FFT) algorithm has been 
studied to decrease the amount of data and computational cost [10, 11]. The ZFFT is the preferred method to magnify the frequency band centered on an arbitrary frequency. Therefore, the ZFFT can increase frequency resolution while keeping the same sampling frequency and number of samples. 
This paper presents an efficient method to detect bearing 
fault by monitoring the stator current using ZFFT analysis. To generate bearing faults and scrutinize the validity of the ZFFT, equipment for generating oscillation is used. Because the ZFFT is efficient regarding the computational cost, the proposed method can give effective way to find out the bearing fault. 
  
2. Stator Current Spectral Analysis 
 
There are several reasons that can cause bearing faults. 
For example, an installation problem can cause  the bearing 
to be unbalanced on the shaft or in the housing. Fig. 2 shows four types of bearing misalignments. Further, a prolonged period of motor drive leads to abrasion in bearings that produce motor vi bration. Since ball bearings 
support the rotor, any bearing fault or unbalance causes a radial movement to the rotor and the stator. The relationship between the bearing vibration and the 
stator current can be described by the air gap eccentricity. Because of the air gap eccentri city, anomalies are produced 
in the air gap flux density an d the predictable frequencies 
are reflected in the stator  current. These predictable 
frequencies, 
bngf, are given by [3] 
 
 bng f cff fm f=± , (1) 
 
where 1, 2, 3, ,f mf="  is the fundamental frequency and 
cff is one of the characteristic  bearing fault frequencies. 
The characteristic frequencies for a bearing fault 
depend on bearing dimensions as shown in Fig. 3. These frequencies can be described by three practicable forms [3]. First, the ball spin frequency is produced by the rotation of each ball. Since the ball makes contact with the inner and outer raceway upon each rotation, the vibration frequency in the stator current is twice the spin frequency and is given by

where PD is the bearing pitch diameter, BD is the ball 
diameter, β is the contact angle of the balls on the races 
and mrf is the mechanical rotor speed in Hertz. 
Next, the outer and inner raceway frequencies need to be 
identified. These frequencies are produced when each ball 
touches a defect in the outer or inner raceway. If the number of balls is n, the vibration occurs n-times in the total cycle. Therefore, the outer and inner raceway frequencies are described as

The three practicable forms of bearing fault frequency 
— (2), (3), and (4) — require bearing dimensions to calculate the exact result. However, the characteristic 
frequencies can be approximated with forms where bearing dimensions are unnecessary [3]. 
 
 
0.4om rf nf=× ×  (5) 
 0.6im rf nf=× × . (6) 
 
These simplified equations can be used for bearings 
between six and twelve balls and allow users to detect bearing faults without accura te understanding about bearing 
dimensions. Therefore, bearing fault analysis can be performed easily by monitoring the stator current. 
  
3. Basic Theory of ZFFT 
 
3.1 Theory of ZFFT 
 
As stated in section II, th e characteristic bearing fault 
frequency is predictable. For frequency analysis of the stator current, FFT-based methods can be implemented. However, the magnitude of these frequencies is much less compared to that of other fre quencies, such as a cyclical 
load torque variation and the fundamental frequency [8]. In addition, because the bearing fault frequencies are already 
known, a specific frequency band is only necessary to detect the bearing fault. A ccordingly, a high-resolution 
frequency analysis technique is required to distinguish these frequencies. 
To increase resolution in the FFT, the sampling time and 
the number of samples need to be increased. However, these methods can lead to an increase in the computational cost. Further, if we only ne ed the particular frequency 
region and high resolution, FFT-based methods require unnecessarily excessive calcu lations. The ZFFT algorithm 
has been studied taking this into consideration. 
The ZFFT is a useful algorithm to expand the narrow 
frequency band centered on any frequency. This is closely related to multi-rate filtering and is the same compared to 
the single sideband modulation [12]. In real applications on DSP-based systems, memory li mitations exist and the size 
of matrices in the FFT prevents augmenting the number of 
samples. Compared with FFT, the ZF FT algorithm can 
provide a direct reduction of sampling frequency while maintaining the same sa mpling time and number of 
samples, thus increasing the frequency resolution. 
A process of the ZFFT algorithm is shown in Fig. 4. Let 
us consider the system of N samples and the sampling frequency, 
sampf , to compare the re solution between the 
ZFFT and the FFT. First, because the FFT is cal culated on th e condition of 
the power of two, the input signal is sampled at 2nN=. 
Then, the frequency resolution is fΔ=sampf/ N. The 
frequency transition is performed to expand a narrow span centered on interested frequency 
cf. This process can be 
conducted by multiplyi ng the real number by cos(2 )cftπ  
and the complex number by sin(2 )cftπ . This is expressed 
as  
 
 [][] e x p (2 ) ( )

cc cxk j ft X f f
xkj f t x k f t j f tπ
ππ π↔−
=+. (7) 
 
The signal []xk is obtained after the process of 
sampling the signal. The complex signal after the frequency transition is  filtered by a low-pass filter with a 
bandwidth 
Bp and [ fc, fc+Bp] is the frequency band of 
interest. 
Second, the filter output signal []Lxk is undersampled. 
This process is called decima tion. In this process, the 
signal []Lxk is extracted for the Mth time where M is a 
decimation factor. Owing to the Mth time sampling, the number of samples reduces to 
N/ M  and the sampling 
frequency also reduces to sampf/ . M Therefore, the 
frequency resolution is fΔ=samp(f / ) / ( / ) M NM  and this 
is the same frequency resolution of  that of the first process. 
Finally, the decimation signal []Mxk is filled with zeros 
at the end of this signal in th e time domain. This process is 
called zero padding. The number  of zeros that fills the

where K is the zero padding factor. 
If zeros of the zero padding process are filled with the 
end of a matrix []Mxk in the time domain, zeros of K are 
inserted in the intervals of each sample in the frequency 
domain. As a result, the number of inserted zeros does not affect the sampling, the sampling frequency is 
sampf/ M 
identically and the frequency resolution is fΔ= 
samp(f / ) / M N. Thus, it is evident th at the ZFFT increases 
the resolution M times more than the FFT. 
When the ZFFT and FFT have the same frequency 
resolution, N ZFFT and N FFT required to the ZFFT and FFT 
are calculated as

Depending on the value of M, C ZFFT can become smaller

3.2 Application of Equipment for Bearing Fault 
 
Bearing faults are classified into single-point defects and 
generalized roughness faults. Single-point defects are defined as a single, localized defect on an otherwise relatively undamaged bearing surface, for example, a pit or spall [7]. Under single-point  defects, the characteristic 
bearing fault frequencies are produced depending on which surface of the bearing contains the faults as described in section II. 
Generalized roughness faults are a type of fault where 
the condition of a bearing surf ace has degraded considerably 
over a large area and has become rough, irregular, or deformed, for example th e overall surface roughness 
produced by a contamination or loss of lubricant [7]. These generalized roughness faults do not exhibit the normal 
frequency characteristic as that of the characteristic bearing fault frequencies. Since they ar e difficult to identify, many 
studies are being conducted to identify these faults. 
Therefore, in this study, the equipment for producing 
bearing faults are installed to prove the validity of the 
ZFFT algorithm for detecting bearing faults under single-
point defects. Fig. 5 shows a model of the equipment for producing bearing faults. As shown in Fig. 5, four bars are installed at the axis of rota tion of a motor and an obstacle 
is raised under the bars so that harmonic frequencies are produced when the motor rota tes. The mechanical rotation 
frequency is based on the motor speed in rpm as 
 
 
120mr p mPfω=× , (11) 
 
where P is the number of poles. 
The harmonic frequencies of the line current produced 
by an obstacle are the quadruple frequency of the mechanical rotation frequency calculated in (11) and the multiple harmonics of the quad ruple frequency as described 
in (12) and (13). 
 
 
hm o s cf fm f=+×  (12) 
 4osc mf f=×, (13) 
 
where oscf is the quadruple frequen cy of the mechanical 
rotation frequency. 
The harmonic frequencies of the line current produced by 
an obstacle in (12) have the same form as the characteristic bearing fault frequencies generate d by a single-point defect 
described from (1) to (4). Thus, the validity of the ZFFT algorithm for detecting bearin g faults under single-point 
defects can be proved through the equipment. 
In this study, the ZFFT algo rithm is conducted via the q-
axis current in a synchronous reference frame. Because oscillation is produced by th e axis of rotation and the 
torque is related to the q-axis current, the quadruple frequency of the mechanical rotation frequency can be detected by the q-axis curr ent without co nsidering the

4. Experimental Results 
 The experiment is implemented using a digital signal 
processor (DSP) TMS320F28335. The model of the equipment for producing bearing faults is realized as Fig. 6. To test the proposed method for bearing fault detection, bearing fault signals are generated from the equipment as the motor rotates at 50 rpm. Line currents of the motor are measured by current sensors to monitor the harmonic frequencies and the amplitude spectrum is calculated to 
show the result of the FFT and ZFFT. The exact parameters of the bearing fault signals are shown in Table 1. 
From (12) and (13), the quadruple frequency of the 
mechanical rotation frequency  is 10/3 Hz and its first 
harmonic frequency is 20/3 Hz. Because the frequency resolution is 0.25 Hz/sample,  the quadruple frequency of 
the mechanical rotation freq uency and its first harmonic 
frequency will appear at th e 13th and 26th samples, 
respectively. 
Since ordinal numbers of the bearing fault signal can be 
calculated, bearing faults can be detected. However, the magnitude of bearing fault frequency is unknown and it is possible that unrelated noises  exist at the corresponding 
bearing fault frequency. Therefore, when an ordinal number of the bearing fault frequency is derived from (12) and (13), the proposed method monitors at a corresponding ordinal number and calculates the average value of its magnitude during a set period. 
Fig. 7 shows the waveform of the FFT. Experiment 
parameters are the same as that in Table 1 to compare the waveform with the ZFFT. The FFT is conducted using an 
a-phase current and the process of frequ ency transition is applied. The quadruple frequency  of the mechanical rotation 
frequency appears at the 3rd sample and its harmonic frequencies appear at the 7th and 10th samples. Because the frequency resolution of th e FFT is 1 Hz/sample, the 
quadruple frequency and its harmonic frequencies are calculated at 3 Hz, 7 Hz, and 10 Hz. Therefore, the errors of each frequency are approximately 0.33 Hz, 0.33 Hz, and 0 Hz. This is because the 10th sample, 30/3 Hz can be divided by the frequency resolution which is 1 Hz/sample and the other samples, 10/3 Hz and 20/3 Hz, cannot be divided. 
Fig. 8 shows the waveform of the ZFFT. The ZFFT is 
also conducted for an a-ph ase current. The quadruple 
frequency of the mechanical rotation frequency is shown at the 13th sample and its harmonic frequencies appear at the 26th and 40th samples. Because the frequency resolution is 4 Hz/sample, the quadruple frequency and its harmonic frequencies are each calculated at 13/4 Hz, 26/4 Hz, and 40/4 Hz. The errors of each frequency are approximately 
0.08 Hz, 0.16 Hz, and 0 Hz. Therefore, the ZFFT is more accurate than the FFT when the number of samples and the sampling frequency are the same. 
Fig. 9 shows waveforms of the q-axis current and its 
frequency analysis on an oscilloscope. Because of the quadruple frequency of the m echanical rotation frequency

is shown in the q-axis current. The expected harmonic frequencies that are the quadruple frequency and its multiple harmonic frequencies from (12) and (13) can be 
detected by FFT with an osc illoscope and the magnitude of 
multiple harmonic frequencies decreases as the frequency of those increases. 
Fig. 10 shows waveforms of the a-phase current and 
ZFFT of the q-axis current. The sampling period shows the number of total samples, which is 512 in this experiment. 
In the waveform of th e ZFFT, multiple harmonic 
frequencies appear as described above. The first frequency of the ZFFT is the quadruple frequency of the mechanical 
rotation frequency and its ordinal number is 13. The other frequencies are the harmonic frequencies of the quadruple frequency. The ordinal numbers of each frequency are 26, 40, and 52, and those frequencies calculated by frequency resolution are 20/3 Hz, 30/3 Hz, and 40/3 Hz. Therefore, frequency analysis of the ZFFT is accurate. 
Fig. 11 shows waveforms of the a-phase current under 
no-load and load conditions a nd the ZFFT of  the q-axis 
current for the healthy machin e. The a-phase current is 
constant and there are no frequencies except noise in the ZFFT spectrum. 
Fig. 12 shows waveforms of the a-phase current under 
no-load and load conditions a nd the ZFFT of  the q-axis 
current for the faulty  machine. The a-phase current changes 
with the motor oscillation and there are harmonic frequencies at 10/3 Hz, 20/3 Hz, and 30/3 Hz. The amplitude of the ZFFT under load condition for the faulty 
machine is smaller than that of the ZFFT under no load 
condition. This is because the fault signals in the q-axis 
current are related to torque an d the load is applied in the 
opposite direction. 
Table 2 shows the computational time of the ZFFT and 
FFT measured at the experiment. The ZFFT and FFT are the same frequency resolution. Since M of the ZFFT is 4, 
the ZFFT has the short com putational time four times 
longer than the FFT.

5. Conclusion 
 This paper proposes the bearing faults detection method 
using ZFFT algorithm. The ZFFT algorithm is very suitable to detect the bearing faults because it analyzes frequencies in narrow frequency band with high frequency resolution which corresponds to  requirements for detecting 
the bearing faults. Additionally , in comparison with the 
FFT algorithm, the ZFFT algor ithm needs smaller data and 
computational cost which are shown in experimental results. Therefore, the proposed method using ZFFT 
algorithm can be applied with motor control algorithms at a 
DSP unit.  
In experiment, the equipment for producing bearing 
faults is designed to prove  the validity of the ZFFT 
algorithm. The harmonic frequencies caused by the equipment have the same form as characteristic bearing fault frequencies. According to the experimental results, we know that the proposed method exactly detects these fault frequencies and those results shows validity of the proposed bearing faults detection.
