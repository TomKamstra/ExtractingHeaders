Blockchain, also coined as decentralized AI, has the potential to empower AI to be more trustworthy by creating
a decentralized trust of privacy, security, and audibility. However, systematic studies on the design principle of
Blockchain as a trust engine for an integrated society of Cyber-Physical-Socia-System (CPSS) are still absent.
In this article, we provide an initiative for seeking the design principle of Blockchain for a better digital world.
Using a hybrid method of qualitative and quantitative studies, we examine the past origin, the current develop-
ment, and the future directions of Blockchain design principles. We have three findings. First, the answers to
whether Blockchain lives up to its original design principle as a distributed database are controversial. Second,
the current development of Blockchain community reveals a taxonomy of 7 categories, including privacy and
security, scalability, decentralization, applicability, governance and regulation, system design, and cross-chain
interoperability. Both research and practice are more centered around the first category of privacy and security
and the fourth category of applicability. Future scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers have vast opportuni-
ties in other, much less exploited facets and the synthesis at the interface of multiple aspects. Finally, in counter-
examples, we conclude that a synthetic solution that crosses discipline boundaries is necessary to close the gaps
between the current design of Blockchain and the design principle of a trust engine for a truly intelligent world.

1 INTRODUCTION
The past one hundred years have witnessed incredible advancements in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) [Littman et al ., 2022, Stone et al ., 2022]. The advancement is integrating cyberspace (CS), phys-
ical space (PS), and social space(SS), into the Cyber-Physical-Social System(CPSS), which expands
the territories of human civilizations [Wang, 2010] extraordinarily. However, AI per se is not enough
to establish trust in CPSS [Jacovi et al ., 2021, Jan et al ., 2020], which is the cornerstone of prosperity
in every civilized society. Blockchain, also coined as decentralized AI , can empower AI to be more
trustworthy by creating a decentralized trust of privacy, security, and audit-ability [Adel et al ., 2022,
Harris and Waggoner, 2019, Hussain and Al-Turjman, 2021]. However, systematic studies on the
design principle of Blockchain as a trust engine for CPSS are still absent. If we could decipher the phi-
losophy of blockchain, we would build the infrastructure of a better digital world. In this article, we
provide an initiative for seeking the design principle of blockchain for the betterment of human civi-
lization. Unlike the existing Systemization of Knowledge (SoK) on blockchain focusing on a specific
discipline purpose or topic of interest, ours aim to open an intellectual conversation beyond bound-
aries for the ultimate goal of a better digital world, namely, the SoK of SoKs. Specifically, we hope to
initiate the answers to three questions for the past, the current, and the future of Blockchain design.
(1)the past. does Blockchain live up to its original design principles as a distributed database?
(2)the current. how do the current Blockchain literature, industry practices, and global standards
address and develop the design principle of Blockchain?
(3)the future. what are the gaps between the current design of Blockchain and the design
principle of a trust engine for a truly intelligent world?
In Section 2, we examine the performance of blockchain by its original design principle as
a distributed database. We present the controversial answers in a dialogue style of debates. In
Section 3, we analyze the current research and practice of blockchain principles by investigating
the current SoKs of emerging blockchain literature, the white papers that provide technique cor-
nerstones for Blockchain technology in the real world, and the discussions on global standards for
Blockchain. We identify a taxonomy of blockchain literature into the seven categories of privacy
and security, scalability, decentralization, applicability, governance and regulation, system design,
and cross-chain interoperability. Integrating the AI of Natural Language Processing (NLP) [Bird
et al., 2009] methods, we find that the current Blockchain design principles, in both research and
practice, are more centered around the first category of privacy and security and the fourth category
of applicability. Future scholars, practitioners, and policymakers have vast opportunities in the
other much less exploit categories and the synthesis at the interface of multiple categories. In
Section 4, we envision the future of blockchain technology by pointing out the gaps between the
current design of blockchain and the design principle of a trust engine for a truly intelligence world.
By providing counterexamples, we question the possibility of developing a plausible solution of
singularity to the gaps without crossing the current boundaries of domain expertise.
Sages in both the west and east have been craving an ideal society. In the Book of Rites , one of the
Confucian (551–479 B.C.E.) classics [Csikszentmihalyi, 2020], the Great Unity is a Chinese vision
of an ideal world in which men of virtue and ability rules. In ancient Greek, Plato [Kraut, 2022]
(429–347 B.C.E.) envisions an ideal city-state ruled by a philosopher-king of justice in the Republic , a
Socratic dialogue. By such a coincidence, both Confucius and Plato place the foundation of an ideal
society on cultivating or selecting the men of virtue to be the administrators that people can trust.WIP: The Design Principle of Blockchain:

Nevertheless, the existence of a benevolent ruler might not be guaranteed. In contrast, Blockchain
enables a new way of trust creation empowered by computer intelligence beyond human ethics.
However, the current blockchain technology is evidently not a panacea for doubts about human trust.
Then why "throw the baby out with the bathwater?" Existing mechanisms for cultivating human
trust have created economic prosperity and human civilizations for thousands of years. How can
we integrate blockchain technology into existing governance, economics, and ethics mechanisms
for an ideal society in the new era of CPSS? We initiate an open dialogue of synthetic solutions.
2 THE PAST
What is Blockchain originally designed for? How does Blockchain live up to the design principle
of its original purpose? Sherman et al .[2019] introduce the origin of blockchain for establishing a
distributed database trusted by mutually suspicious groups. Bayer et al .[1993], Haber and Stornetta
[1990], Narayanan et al .[2016] further elaborate on the follow-up development of Blockchain
technology for a series of desired properties such as decentralization, immutability, transparency,
security, and efficiency. Figure 2 shows the answer returned by Generative Pre-trained Transformer
(ChatGPT), https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/, a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022, to
the question "what is the design principle of blockchain?" The answer accurately matches elabora-
tions in earlier blockchain literature. We now examine the performance of Blockchain on each prin-
ciple in a dialogue style of debates in the spirits of Confucius’s the Analects [Ames and Rosemont Jr,4 Sunshine Zhang
2010] and Plato’s the Republic [Plato, 2005]. We find the answer to be controversial. Moreover, the
desired principles might conflict with each other or lead to other undesired consequences.
Question 1: does Blockchain live up to its promise of decentralization?
2.0.1 Pros. Yes, Blockchain is decentralized. Compared with centralized ledgers, Blockchain is not
subject to single point failure of a centralized entity [Puthal et al ., 2018]. Blockchain record and
validate data by a consensus protocol involving decentralized entities, which has the fault tolerance
of minorities [Zhang and Tian, 2022].
2.0.2 Cons. No, Blockchain is not decentralized. Sai et al .[2021] provides a taxonomy of blockchain
centralization in 13 aspects. For example, Sai et al .[2021] shows that the top four mining pools in
Ethereum (Bitcoin) consist of 63.04% (50.36%) of the hashing power, which are enough to conduct
a successful malicious attack. Moreover, Zhang et al .[2022] and the references therein show that
the usage of blockchain at the application layer has the trend of conversing to centralization.
Question 2: does Blockchain live up to its promise of immutability?
2.0.3 Pros. Yes, Blockchain is immutable. Narayanan et al .[2016] elaborate on the difficulty of
manipulating the recorded data due to the chain structure of Merkle trees.
2.0.4 Cons. No, Blockchain is mutable. Hofmann et al .[2017] shows that the immutability of
blockchain can be breached by various attacks. Politou et al .[2019] even addresses the conflicts
between Blockchain’s immutability and the new European data protection regulation on the Right
to be Forgotten (RtbF), according to which individuals have the right to delete their personal data
under certain conditions.
Question 3: does Blockchain live up to its promise of transparency?
2.0.5 Pros. Yes, Blockchain is transparent. [Monrat et al ., 2019] explains that all the transactions
on Blockchain are recorded and auditable by each Replica node in the network.
2.0.6 Cons. No, Blockchain is not transparent. Sai et al .[2021] demonstrates the centralization in
node operation, which is required to audit the Blockchain data due to technique barriers. Feng et al .
[2019] even point out the transparency of Blockchain as a negative feature, a threat to user privacy.
Question 4: does Blockchain live up to its promise of security?
2.0.7 Pros. Yes, Blockchain is secure. Zhang et al .[2019] address the Blockchain security prop-
erty of consistency and integrity achieved by the main techniques of consensus algorithms and
hash-chained storage.
2.0.8 Cons. No, Blockchain is not secure. Lin and Liao [2017] evidences a long list of real attacks
on Blockchain together with analyzing potential security issues. Budish [2022] even conclude that
the mechanism supporting Blockchain security is either vulnerable or not worth the economic cost.
Question 5: does Blockchain live up to its promise of efficiency?
2.0.9 Pros. Yes, Blockchain is efficient. Wang et al .[2019a] analyze how Blockchain improves
efficiency in human interactions by automating and streamlining business operations using smart
contracts.
2.0.10 Cons. No, Blockchain is not efficient. The current major blockchains can only sustain
tens of transactions per second (TPS), not comparable to the centralized platforms, which have
a throughput of thousands of TPS [Chauhan et al., 2018].WIP: The Design Principle of Blockchain:

3 THE CURRENT
How do the current Blockchain literature, industry practices, and global standards address and
develop the design principle of Blockchain? We collect all the Systemization of Knowledge (SoK)
papers related to facets of Blockchain or surveys and review articles that satisfy the defining features
of SoKs. We refer the readers to the JSys website, https://www.jsys.org/type_SoK/, for background
information on SoKs and the Oakland conference GitHub site, https://oaklandsok.github.io/, for
the histories of SoK in computer security and privacy literature. We present a taxonomy of the
collected SoKs in Table 1 and Table 2 into seven categories based on the topic of research questions.
•Category 1: Privacy and Security. We include literature that answers questions about private
information protection and attacks on Blockchain systems. We refer the readers to DeCew
[2018] for the philosophical symposium on privacy and Bishop [2003] for the computer
science insights on security .
•Category 2: Scalability. We include literature that answers questions related to the scalable
deployment of Blockchain usually measured in throughput and quality of service. We refer the
readers to Jogalekar and Woodside [2000] for the definition and measurement of scalability
in the distributed system literature.
•Category 3: Decentralization. We include the literature that answers questions related to the
designed and realized decentralization of Blockchain. We refer the readers to Zhang et al .
[2022] for an interdisciplinary synthesis for a taxonomy of Blockchain decentralization.
•Category 4: Applicability. We include literature that answers questions related to the applica-
tion of Blockchain to solve social and economic issues in various human interactions. Table 2
shows that the major applications are in financial services [Chen and Bellavitis, 2020, Harvey
et al., 2021, Zetzsche et al., 2020].
•Category 5: Governance and Regulation. We include literature that answers questions related
to utilizing Blockchain as a new way of governance, the process of interaction of an organized
society, and its interactions with existing governance solutions, including corporate, govern-
ment, and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs). We refer the readers to [Bevir, 2012] for
a review of existing governance solutions, including various forms of social coordination and
patterns of rules
•Category 6: System design. We include literature that answers questions related to designing
Blockchain as an advancement of existing computer systems. We refer the readers to Saltzer
and Kaashoek [2009] for the design principles of computer systems.
•Category 7: Cross-chain and Interoperability. We include literature that answers questions
related to communication, cooperation, and integration among Blockchain systems, other
computer systems, and human societies. We refer the readers to Wegner [1996] and Leal et al .
[2019] for the importance and assessment of interoperability among information systems.
Table 6 lists the top 28 blockchain projects, excluding applications on the Blockchain and cross-
chain solutions ranked by the market value of its native currency retried from Coinmarketcap,
https://coinmarketcap.com/, on Dec. 27, 2022. We further collect the white papers that provide the
technical foundations for the 28 projects. We then conduct a text analysis applying natural language
processing (NLP) methods to produce the word cloud and bigram networks of the titles and abstracts
of the SoKs and white papers. The results are presented in Table 4, Table 5, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9,
Figure 1, Figure 8, Figure 3, Figure 7, Figure 6, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 9, Figure 8. The word cloud
distinguish the word frequency in these documents in font size and the bigram represents the
co-appearance of two words in sequential order ranking by counts in the tables and in the network
figures. We also further research the emerging documents of blockchain standard development
and papers discussing blockchain standards by working groups and institutions globally.6 Sunshine Zhang
Data and Code Availability : We open source the data and code for replication and future
research on the Github: https://github.com/sunshineluyao/design-principle-blockchain.
we find that the current Blockchain design principles, in both research and practice, are more
centered around the first category of privacy and security and the fourth category of applicability.
Future scholars, practitioners, and policymakers have vast opportunities in the other much less
exploit categories and the synthesis at the interface of multiple categories.
4 THE FUTURE
What are the gaps between the current design of Blockchain and the design principle of a trust
engine for a truly intelligent world? In this section, we are not intended for a comprehensive answer.
Instead, we question the possibility of developing a plausible solution of singularity to the gaps
without crossing the current boundaries of domain expertise by providing counterexamples.
Case Study 1:
How to elaborate on the design principle of privacy and security for a better society?
The scientific community of distributed systems and cryptography made great milestones in
Blockchain development by achieving the anonymity of private information and the audibility of
public transactions. However, privacy and security are only the means but not necessarily the ends
for a better society of human prosperity. Historically, Critiques [DeCew, 2018] addresses privacy
as the source of criminal activities, economic inefficiency, and the abuse of minorities. Cong et al .
[2022b] identify that wash trading count for around 70% of total cryptocurrency trading volumes.
Cong et al .[2022a] further provides a taxonomy of crimes enabled by the anonymity feature on
Blockchain. Abundant literature in behavioral science [Dawson, 2018] establishes the connection
between anonymity and abusive behavior. However, none of those negative effects on human
behavior are considered in the original design principles of Blockchain. How can we redesign pri-
vacy and security to cultivate human cooperation better and minimize abusive behavior? Behavior
scientists have the expertise to contribute.
Case Study 2:
How to elaborate on the design principle of decentralization for a better society?
Most top-ranked Blockchain projects aim to create a permissionless system that is more inclu-
sive, democratic, and decentralized. However, what is required to satisfy the permission for the
permissionless Blockchains? You must have access to the internet, afford the computer system
requirements to run a Replica node, and master engineering skills to participate in the network.
Unfortunately, according to World in Data, https://ourworldindata.org/internet, in most parts of our
world, less than half of the population have access to the internet. Let alone the higher requirements
of computer system and engineering skills. Moreover, Ao et al .[2022] and the references therein
evidence most of the crypto transactions are executed via centralized exchanges but not in the
decentralized form of on-chain peer-to-peer transactions. Cong et al .[2022c] further addresses the
inclusion issues of the current Web 3 economy due to technology barriers and lack of inclusion
consideration in the original design principle of Blockchain. The famous Irish playwright Bernard
Shaw says: "Revolutions have never lightened the burden of tyranny. They have only shifted it
to another shoulder" [Tiliouine and Estes, 2016]. To direct Blockchain development to avoid the
fate stated by Bernard Shaw and serve a more decentralized society of the people, by the people,
for the people, anthropologists, social scientists, and economists are able to contribute to designing
a society of democracy, diversity, and inclusion.WIP: The Design Principle of Blockchain:
An Initiative for the SoK of SoKs 7
Case Study 3:
How to elaborate on the design principle of efficiency for a better society?
The current solutions for efficiency or scalability on Blockchain focus on improving transaction
throughput and automating business processes. However, the pursuit of efficiency in an isolated
system of short-sighted consideration might lead to inefficiency for the society as a whole for long-
term sustainability. For example, the current scalability solutions generally consider the Blockchain
system only in isolation but ignore the negative externality of the high-energy consumption design
to the outside world [Truby, 2018]. Moreover, Grimmelmann [2019] points out that although smart
contracts automate business processes, the current design ignores the ambiguity in the semantics of
the programming language. Thus, a temporary convenience of the smart contract operation might
lead to costly disputes in unforeseen scenarios when developers and users disagree. Policy-makers
and lawyers can contribute to reconsidering the Blockchain design to improve the efficiency of
negotiations among different stakeholders and our society as a whole.
A Call for Collaboration
Kranzberg [1986] states in his 1985 address as president of the Society for the History of Technology
(SHOT): "Technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral." Blockchain is a powerful technology
that brings lots of new possibilities. How can we redesign blockchain for a truly intelligent world?
We call for a joint endeavor from all disciplines.
