Law and Word Order: NLP in Legal Tech

(Received 4th November 2018 )
Abstract
The law has language at its heart, so it’s not surprising that software that operates on natural
language has played a role in some areas of the legal profession for a long time. But the lastfew years have seen an increased interest in applying modern techniques to a wider range of
problems, so I look here at how natural language processing is being used in the legal sector
today.
The Legal NLP Landscape
The application of natural language processing, and artiﬁcial intelligence more
generally, in the legal profession is not a new thing. The earliest systems for
searching online legal content appeared in the 1960s and 1970s, and legal expertsystems were a hot topic of discussion in the 1970s and 1980s.
1But the last few
years have seen a signiﬁcant upsurge of interest in the area, including, as you mightexpect, an increasing number of start-ups claiming to apply deep learning techniquesin the context of speciﬁc legal applications.
For a recent project, I had to review how NLP was being used in what has become
known as Legal Tech. It turns out to be a densely populated space: a website atStanford lists 1084 companies ‘changing the way legal is done’.
2In reviewing such
a landscape, it helps to have a map. Conveniently, the practice of the law is awell-structured activity, with point solutions being available for a number of speciﬁctasks that a typical law ﬁrm faces. My take is that there are ﬁve areas of legalactivity where NLP is playing an increasing role:
•Legal research: ﬁnding information relevant to a legal decision
•Electronic discovery: determining the relevance of documents to an informa-
tion request
•Contract review: checking that a contract is complete and avoids risk

•Document automation: generating routine legal documents
•Legal advice: using question-and-answer dialogs to provide tailored advice
These brief deﬁnitions hide some complexity, which I’ll unwrap below as I consider
each area in turn.
Legal research
Legal research is the process of ﬁnding information that is needed to support legal
decision-making. In practice, this generally means searching through both statute(as created by the legislature) and case law (as developed by the courts) to ﬁnd whatis relevant for some speciﬁc matter at hand.
That’s a key purpose for the neatly organised bookshelves of thick bound volumes
you see obligatorily lining the walls of lawyers’ oﬃces in court-room dramas andtalking-head interviews. However, said volumes are often referred to as ‘dusty tomes’for a reason: poring over the pages on a law library desk has long been displacedby electronic search and retrieval mechanisms.
LexisNexis (then called simply LEXIS) ﬁrst appeared in the early 1970s, initially
oﬀering full text search of Ohio and New York case law; and it just grew from there.By the late 1970s, lawyers were able to access the database using dial-up servicesfrom dedicated terminals via 1200 baud modems. By the late 1990s, the data was onthe web. Today Lexis Nexis claims to have over 30TB of content. Westlaw, anotherbig player in the legal database world, was also founded in the mid-1970s, and wasacquired by Thomson Corporation (now Thomson Reuters) in 1996. Add WoltersKluwer and Bloomberg Law and you have the four major established providersin this space. Most law ﬁrms will have subscriptions to some or all of these
services.
Despite the fact that the major players are so well-established, however, a number
of newer players have captured some market share by oﬀering smarter technologiesthat aim to improve the precision and recall of searches, beyond what can beachieved using ‘traditional techniques’, which here amount to good old-fashionedBoolean search and hand-constructed indexes.
Clearly the quality of the results of searching depends signiﬁcantly on posing the
right queries. Both CaseText
3and CaseMine4provide interfaces that let you ﬁnd
related material by uploading a passage or even an entire brief that provides contextfor the search, thus supporting ‘query by document’. In each case, this functionalityis augmented by a range of neat UI features that facilitate the search task. As wellas sidestepping the need to labour over appropriately-detailed search queries, thisalso increases the likelihood that additional relevant material not found by typicalqueries will be located.

Taking a slightly diﬀerent approach, Ross Intelligence5(which uses IBM Watson)
and vLex6(with a product called Vincent) oﬀer natural language query interfaces,
so that ‘you can pose your research questions like you’re talking to another lawyer’.
Of course, the big four have been quick to build out their own ‘AI-powered’
solutions. In July 2018, LexisNexis launched Lexis Analytics, a legal research toolwhich incorporates the acquisition of machine learning and NLP start-up RavelLaw, amongst others. More or less at the same time, Thomson Reuters launchedWestSearch Plus, a new search engine that claims to use state-of-the-art AI.
Electronic discovery
Electronic discovery, or e-discovery, is the process of identifying and collecting
electronically-stored information in response to a request for production in a lawsuit or investigation. Faced with the hundreds of thousands of ﬁles that might reside
on a typical hard drive, a key issue here is separating that content into what’s
relevant (or ‘responsive’, in the terminology of the domain) and what’s not. In acase around a recent patent dispute with Apple, Samsung collected and processedabout 3.6TB, or 11,108,653 documents; the cost of processing that evidence over a20-month period was said to be more than US$13 million dollars.
7
Today, the battle for market share is around optimised techniques for categorising
whether documents are relevant as quickly and eﬃciently as possible. This processis called ‘technology-assisted review’ (‘TAR’), and was for a number of years afocus of activity in the TREC Legal Track.
8As with legal research, traditional
approaches involved keyword or Boolean search, followed by manual review. Moremodern approaches use machine learning for document classiﬁcation, referred to as‘predictive coding’ in the legal profession. You want to maximise both precision andrecall, while keeping the eﬀort involved (in terms of the number of documents ahuman has to annotate or review) to a reasonable level. There is some debate in thelegal community about the pros and cons of various techniques, and in particulararound what counts as a reasonable seed set, and whether passive or active learningis better, where the former involves random selection of documents for humantagging, and the latter involves deliberate machine selection of either uncertain or,alternatively, assumed-relevant examples.
9
Probably the biggest player in this space is Exterro.10Their newest technology,
called Smart Labelling, avoids the need for users to provide initial seed sets of
human-tagged documents, selecting for review the most relevant documents from

the outset of the review process. DISCO11has a similar deep-learning-based solution
in its ‘Prioritized Review’ process.
Everlaw,12on the other hand, seems still be using an approach where an initial
seed set (they suggest 200 documents) must ﬁrst be tagged. UI features can beimportant diﬀerentiators: Relativity,
13previously known as kCura, also provides a
phone app so you can ‘code documents on your commute or on the couch’. Lawyersare 24/7 too.
Interestingly, generic NLP providers are also moving into the area. OpenText
has introduced an e-discovery platform called Axcelerate;
14and SDL, known for
its translation products and services, provides a Multilingual eDiscovery Solution,enabling access to foreign language case-related content via translation.

Contract review
A common activity for lawyers is to review contracts, make comments and changes,
and advise their clients on whether to sign or negotiate for better terms. Thecontracts in question can be relatively simple, such as non-disclosure agreements(NDAs), or very large and complex, stretching to many hundreds of pages.
Automated contract review systems can be used to review documents which are
relatively standardised and predictable in terms of the kinds of content they contain.The process involves decomposing the contract into its individual provisions orclauses, and then assessing each of these, either to extract key information or tocompare against some standard (which might just be the set of other instances ofsuch contracts held by a ﬁrm). So, for example, a contract review system mightindicate the absence of a clause covering bribery, or indicate that a clause coveringprice increases fails to specify a percentage limit.
Contract review may be at the level of the individual contract, or—say, in the case
of due diligence for a corporate acquisition—it may involve reviewing thousands of
contracts on ﬁle. In the latter case, the technology begins to also incorporate aspectsof what has become known as legal analytics, aggregating information across thedata set to detect anomalies and outliers, and producing charts or tables that makeit easy to compare across documents.
Contract review has generated a signiﬁcant amount of interest in the last few
years. Early approaches once more used the presence of key terms and headings toguide information extraction, and it’s likely that many oﬀerings still make use ofsome proportion of rule-based technology; however, not surprisingly, pretty muchall the recent entrants into the space are using more sophisticated machine learningtechniques.

Three of the largest players here are Kira Systems,16Seal Software17and
LawGeex.18Kira provides pre-built models for around 500 common provisions
covering a range of contract types; you indicate which are relevant for the contractbeing reviewed, and you can also build custom models for provisions not alreadycatered for. Seal oﬀers similar capabilities but adds a logic engine that lets youapply business logic to the data extracted from the contracts reviewed; LawGeexemphasises the ability to compare contracts against pre-deﬁned company policies.
A typical strategy for newer and smaller entrants seems to be that of beginning
by focussing on quite speciﬁc document types, such as NDAs, real-estate leases,and privacy policies, and then increasing the range of documents dealt with as thecompany gains customers and traction. Leverton,
19which was spun out of DFKI,
focusses primarily on real estate documents. Targetting companies with large realestate portfolios, it processes contracts in 20 languages. Other smaller players wortha look are eBrevia,
20Eigen Technologies,21LegalSifter,22and Luminance,23but there
are many many others.
Not surprisingly, generic text analytics companies are also attracted to this use
case: see ABBYY Text Analytics for Contracts,24Ayﬁe Contract Analysis,25and
OpenText Perceptiv.26
Both ContractProbe27and PrivacyPolicyCheck28have online demos that let you
upload documents for review. These are much simpler than the products discussedabove, but they give a ﬂavour of what contract review applications can do.
Document automation and legal advice
There’s a fuzzy boundary between document automation systems and legal advice
applications, so I’ll consider the two categories together.
Legal advisors are interactive systems which, based on a set of questions posed
by the system, produce advice tailored to the circumstances and requirements of theuser. In many cases, the output is a legal document of some kind, so legal adviceoften amounts to document automation.
Document automation systems, on the other hand, typically use some kind of ﬁll-
in-the-blanks templating mechanism that enables the creation of a legal document
tailored to speciﬁc criteria. In some cases, the data required to generate the documentis obtained via an iterative question-and-answer dialog: a chatbot, if you like. In

such circumstances, the document automation sytem has the same kind of interface
as that provided by a legal advice system.
The most publicly visible legal advisor is DoNotPay, an interactive tool whose
initial focus was to help members of the general public to appeal parking tickets.29
The scope of the application has grown immensely since then; at the time of writing,the DoNotPay app supports 14 diﬀerent uses cases, including ﬁghting unfair bank,credit card and overdraft fees, getting refunds from Uber and Lyft when a drivertakes a wrong turn, and claiming refunds for late package deliveries.
30
DoNotPay was created by Joshua Browder, a student at Stanford, in response
to his own parking ticket experiences; but law ﬁrms are also interested in oﬀeringlegal advice systems. Automation has clear advantages here, making available legalservices to those who might not otherwise be able to aﬀord them or be willing topay for them.
So, for example, Norton Rose Fulbright, an Australian law ﬁrm, released at the
end of 2017 a chatbot for privacy law concerns.
31Built using IBM Watson, the tool
answers standard questions about data breaches. The ﬁrm has since extended theapplication to handle GDPR queries.
Neota Logic,
32which has been around since 2010, provides a platform for creating
expert advisors; the technology application is in fact much broader than this suggests,
since it can also be used for workﬂow automation and related tasks, includingdocument automation, which I turn to next.
Legal document automation applications have been around for a long time, and
are arguably amongst the earliest commercial natural language generation systems.Some researchers would be loath to call these template-based systems NLG, but thereality is that the technology used is similar to that oﬀered by the leading commercialNLG vendors today.
These systems typically work by gathering relevant data from the user, either via
form-ﬁlling or via a question-and-answer session, as noted above. The accumulateddata is then used in a rule-based manner to craft a tailored document, via acombination of conditional document assembly and template slot-ﬁlling.
The most well-known oﬀering in this category is Thomson Reuters’ Contract
Express,
33whose target market is law ﬁrms that want to increase eﬃciency.
There are other prominent players, including Rocket Lawyer,34which is more
consumer-focussed, and Neota Logic (mentioned above), who provide both a genericIntelligent Document Automation facility as well as a more end-user-oriented speciﬁcapplication call PerfectNDA.

More generally, a number of organisations position their document automa-
tion oﬀerings in the access-to-justice space, making tailored legal documentationeasily available to the general public. Two such examples are A2J Author

Final judgement
As in many other areas, the nature of work in the legal profession is under threat
from NLP and AI more generally. In early 2016, Deloitte found that 39% of jobsin the legal sector stood to be automated in the following ten years.
40Recently,
McKinsey estimated that 22% of a lawyer’s job and 35% of a law clerk’s jobcould be automated.
41And as is common in other areas, you’ll often see a positive
spin put on this, with the usual claims that ‘the technology frees up workers todo more interesting things’. But the pros and cons of technology uptake are apoint of occasionally heated debate in the profession, which Richard Tromanscharacterises as consisting of conservatives who want to hang on to the status quo
and progressives who want change.
42A major barrier to change, of course, is that
the legal profession has traditionally operated on the basis of billable hours. In thatcontext, if a technology increases eﬃciency, it also reduces what you can put on theclock. On the other side, disruption of traditional approaches is inevitable in theface of increasing demands from acess-to-justice movements across the world.
I’d say the jury’s no longer out on this one.
