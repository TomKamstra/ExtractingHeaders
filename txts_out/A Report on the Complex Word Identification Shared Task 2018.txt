Abstract
We report the Ô¨Åndings of the second Com-
plex Word IdentiÔ¨Åcation (CWI) shared task
organized as part of the BEA workshop co-
located with NAACL-HLT‚Äô2018. The sec-
ond CWI shared task featured multilingual and
multi-genre datasets divided into four tracks:
English monolingual, German monolingual,
Spanish monolingual, and a multilingual track
with a French test set, and two tasks: binary
classiÔ¨Åcation and probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation.
A total of 12 teams submitted their results
in different task/track combinations and 11 of
them wrote system description papers that are
referred to in this report and appear in the BEA
workshop proceedings.
1 Introduction
The most common Ô¨Årst step in lexical simpliÔ¨Å-
cation pipelines is identifying which words are
considered complex by a given target population
(Shardlow, 2013). This task is known as complex
word identiÔ¨Åcation (CWI) and it has been attract-
ing attention from the research community in the
past few years.
In this paper we present the Ô¨Åndings of the sec-
ond Complex Word IdentiÔ¨Åcation (CWI) shared
task organized as part of the thirteenth Work-
shop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building
Educational Applications (BEA) co-located with
NAACL-HLT‚Äô2018. The second CWI shared
task follows a successful Ô¨Årst edition featuring 21
teams organized at SemEval‚Äô2016 (Paetzold and
Specia, 2016a). While the Ô¨Årst CWI shared task
targeted an English dataset, the second edition fo-
cused on multilingualism providing datasets con-
taining four languages: English, German, French,
and Spanish.In an evaluation paper (Zampieri et al., 2017), it
has been shown that the performance of an ensem-
ble classiÔ¨Åer built on top of the predictions of the
participating systems in the 2016 task degraded,
the more systems were added. The low perfor-
mance of the CWI systems that competed in the
Ô¨Årst CWI task left much room for improvement
and was one of the reasons that motivated us to
organize this second edition.
1.1 Task Description
The goal of the CWI shared task of 2018 is to
predict which words challenge non-native speak-
ers based on the annotations collected from both
native and non-native speakers. To train their sys-
tems, participants received a labeled training set
where words in context were annotated regarding
their complexity. One month later, an unlabeled
test set was provided and participating teams were
required to upload their predictions for evaluation.
More information about the data collection is pre-
sented in Section 3.
Given the multilingual dataset provided, the
CWI challenge was divided into four tracks:
English monolingual CWI;
German monolingual CWI;
Spanish monolingual CWI; and
Multilingual CWI with a French test set.
For the Ô¨Årst three tracks, participants were pro-
vided with training and testing data for the same
language. For French, participants were provided
only with a French test set and no French training
data. In the CWI 2016, the task was cast as binary
classiÔ¨Åcation. To be able to capture complexity
as a continuum, in our CWI 2018 shared task, wearXiv:1804.09132v1  [cs.CL]  24 Apr 2018additionally included a probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation
task. The two tasks are summarized as follows:
Binary classiÔ¨Åcation task: Participants were
asked to label the target words in context as
complex (1) or simple (0).
Probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation task: Partici-
pants were asked to assign the probability of
target words in context being complex.
Participants were free to choose the task/track
combinations they would like to participate in.
2 Related Work
Until the appearance of the CWI shared task of
2016, there was no manually annotated and veri-
Ô¨Åed CWI dataset. The 2016 shared task brought us
one of the largest CWI datasets to that date, con-
sisting of a total of 9,200 sentences manually an-
notated by 400 different non-native English speak-
ers. In total, 200 sentences are used as a training
set where each target is annotated by 20 annota-
tors. The rest of the dataset (9,000 sentences) are
used for test set where each target is annotated by
a single annotator from the entire pool of 400 an-
notators.
The approaches used in the Ô¨Årst SemEval 2016
Task 11: Complex Word IdentiÔ¨Åcation are de-
scribed in Table 1.
3 Datasets
We have used the CWIG3G2 datasets from (Yi-
mam et al., 2017b,a) for the complex word iden-
tiÔ¨Åcation (CWI) shared task 2018. The datasets
are collected for multiple languages ( English ,Ger-
man,Spanish ). The English datasets cover differ-
ent text genres, namely News (professionally writ-
ten news), WikiNews (news written by amateurs),
andWikipedia articles . Below, we will brieÔ¨Çy de-
scribe the annotation process and the statistics of
collected datasets. For detail explanation of the
datasets, please refer to the works of Yimam et al.
(2017b,a)
Furthermore, to bolster the cross-lingual CWI
experiment, we have collected a CWI dataset for
French. The French dataset was collected through
the same method used for the CWIG3G2 cor-
pus (Yimam et al., 2017b,a). The dataset con-
tains Wikipedia texts extracted from a compara-
ble simpliÔ¨Åed corpus collected by Brouwers et al.
(2014). Similar to CWIG3G2, for each article,all paragraphs containing between 5 and 10 sen-
tences were extracted. From this pool of para-
graphs, only the best paragraph was selected via
a ranking procedure maximizing sentence length
and lexical richness, and minimizing the ratio of
named entities and foreign words. From this large
selection of best paragraphs per article, an optimal
subset of 100 paragraphs was then selected using
a greedy search procedure similar to that of Tack
et al. (2016), minimizing the vocabulary overlap
between pairs of paragraphs using the Jaccard co-
efÔ¨Åcient. Finally, a random test split of 24 para-
graphs was selected to be annotated.
3.1 Annotation Process
Annotations were collected using the Amazon
Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Instead of showing a
single sentence, we presented 5 to 10 sentences to
the annotator in a single HIT (Human Intelligence
Task) and requested them to highlight words or
phrases that could pose difÔ¨Åculty in understanding
the paragraph. The annotation system is unique
in many aspects such as: 1) The instruction makes
clear that the annotators should assume a given tar-
get reader such as children, language learners or
people with reading impairments. 2) A bonus re-
ward is offered when the user‚Äôs selection matches
at least half of the other annotations to encourage
extra care during the complex word or phrase (CP)
selection. 3) The maximum number of annotations
allowed is limited to 10 so that we could prohibit
an arbitrarily large number of selections intend-
ing to attain the bonus reward. 4) For the English
dataset, more than 20 annotators were able to an-
notate the same HIT, among which are at least 10
native English speakers and 10 non-native English
speakers so that it is possible to investigate if na-
tive and non-native speakers have different CWI
needs. 5) Complex words are not pre-highlighted,
as in previous contributions, so that annotators
are not biased to the pre-selection of the complex
phrases. 6) In addition to single words, we allowed
the annotation of multi-word expressions (MWE),
up to a size of 50 characters.
Table 2 shows the total, native, and non-native
number of annotators that participated in the an-
notation task.

An analysis of the English dataset shows that
around 90% of complex phrases have been se-
lected by at least two annotators (both native and
non-native). When separated by language, thepercentage of agreements decreases to 83% at
the lowest. This might be because native and
non-native annotators have a different perspective
what is a complex phrase. Furthermore, we have
seen that native annotators agree more within their
group (84% and above) than non-native speakers
(83% and above). We also see that the absolute
agreement between native and non-native anno-
tators is very low (70%), which further indicates
that the two user groups might have different CWI
needs.
For the German annotation task, we have fewer
annotators than the other languages. As it can
be seen from Table 2, there are more native an-
notators, but they participate on fewer HITs than
the non-native annotators (on average, 6.1 non-
native speakers and 3.9 native speakers partici-
pated in a HIT). Unlike the English annotation
task, non-native annotators have a higher inter-
annotator agreement (70.66%) than the native an-
notators (58.5%).The Spanish annotation task is different from
both the English and the German annotation tasks
since its annotations come almost exclusively
from native annotators. In general, Spanish anno-
tators have shown lower agreements than the En-
glish and German annotators. Also the Spanish
annotators highlight more MWEs than the English
and German annotators.
Regarding the French annotation task, we ob-
serve a comparable distribution in the number of
native and non-native annotators compared to the
German annotation task (Table 2). There were
slightly more non-native participants than native
ones, but the number of native annotators who
completed the same number of HITs was consid-
erably larger. This means that although there were
more non-native participants, they did not partici-
pate equally in all HITs.

Table 4: The number (#) and ratio (%) of complex in-
stances per language
A striking difference that can be observed in
the French dataset pertains to the proportion of
identiÔ¨Åed complex words. Compared to the other
languages, we have a considerably lower relative
count of complex instances (Table 4). However,
this does not necessarily mean that the texts were
simpler for French than for the other languages.
Looking at the proportion of MWEs annotated as
complex (Table 5), we observe that the French
dataset contains more MWE annotations than sin-
gle words compared to the other datasets. One
plausible explanation for this could be attributed
to the limitation of allowing at most 10 unique an-
notations per HIT in MTurk. Indeed, a number
of annotators highlighted the fact that they some-
times found more than 10 possible annotations of
complex words. As a result, in order to account for
all of these possibilities, the annotators sometimes
grouped nearly adjacent single complex words as
one sequence, leading to a larger relative propor-
tion of MWE (3-gram+) annotations. Another ex-
planation for this disparity could be attributed to
the lower number of annotators for French com-pared to English or Spanish. If we had had a sim-
ilar number of annotators for French, we would
probably also have obtained a more varied sam-
ple and hence a higher relative amount of different
complex word annotations.

4 System Descriptions and Results
In this section, we brieÔ¨Çy describe the systems
from all 11 teams that have participated in the
2018 CWI shared task and wrote a system descrip-
tion paper to be presented at the BEA conference.
Table 6 and 7 shows the results of all systems for
the monolingual and multilingual binary classiÔ¨Å-
cation tasks while Table 8 and 9 presents the prob-
abilistic classiÔ¨Åcation results for the monolingual
and multilingual tracks.
4.1 Baseline Systems
For both the binary and probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation
tasks, we build a simple baseline system that uses
only the most basic features described in Yimam
et al. (2017b,a), namely only frequency and length
features. The Nearest Centroid classiÔ¨Åer and the
Linear Regression algorithms from the scikit-learn
machine learning library are used for the binary
and probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation tasks resp. For the
binary classiÔ¨Åcation task, we have used the accu-
racy and macro-averaged F1 evaluation metrics.
For the probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation task, the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) measure is used. The base-
line results are shown in Table 6, 7, 8, and 9 for
the monolingual and multilingual tracks.

The pipeline consists of feature extraction, com-
puting a kernel matrix and applying an SVM clas-
siÔ¨Åer.
The feature sets include low-level features such
as character n-grams, and high-level features such
semantic properties extracted from lexical re-
sources and word embeddings. The low-level fea-
tures were extracted based on the target complexword, and include count of characters, count of
vowels, count of consonants, count of repeating
characters, and count of character n-grams (up to
4 characters).

sentence (minimum, maximum and mean simi-
larity values are used). Furthermore, sense em-
beddings are used, which are computed based on
WordNet synsets. Lastly, using word embeddings,
additional features were designed based on the lo-
cation of the complex word in a dimensionally re-
duced embedding space. For this, they used PCA
to reduce the dimension of the embeddings from
300 to 2 dimensions.
Once features are extracted, kernel-based learn-
ing algorithms are employed. For the binary clas-
siÔ¨Åcation setup, the SVM classiÔ¨Åers based on the
Lib-SVM were used. For the regression setup,
they used v-Support Vector Regression (v-SVR).
For both setups, different parameters were tuned
using the development dataset.
SB@GU systems (Alfter and Pil ¬¥an, 2018) are
adapted from a previous system, which was used
to classify Swedish words into different language
proÔ¨Åciency levels and participated on the mul-
tilingual binary classiÔ¨Åcation part of the shared
task. For each target word or MWE, the follow-
ing set of feature categories were extracted: 1)
count and word form features such as length of the
target, number of syllables, n-gram probabilities
based on Wikipedia, binary features such as ‚Äúis
MWE‚Äù or ‚Äúis number‚Äù, and so on 2) morpholog-
ical features, mainly part-of-speech tag and sufÔ¨Åx
length, 3) semantic features, such as the number
of synsets, number of hypernyms, and number ofhyponyms, 4) context features, like topic distribu-
tions and word embeddings, and 5) psycholinguis-
tic features, such as British National Corpus fre-
quency, reaction time, bigram frequency, trigram
frequency, and so on. For MWE, they averaged
the feature values for each word in them.
For English datasets, experiments are con-
ducted with context-free, context-only and
context-sensitive features, mainly by excluding
word embeddings, using only word embeddings,
and combining all features explained above
respectively. ClassiÔ¨Åers such as Random Forest,
Extra Trees, convolutional networks, and recur-
rent convolutional neural networks were tested.
Furthermore, feature selection is performed using
the SelectFromModel feature selection method
from scikit-learn library. The best performing
features includes word frequency, word sense and
topics, and language model probabilities.
For the German, Spanish, and French datasets,
features such as character-level n-grams were ex-
tracted from n-gram models trained on Wikipedia.
For the French dataset, the n-gram models from
English, German and Spanish were used to obtain
n-gram probabilities of each entry. They conÔ¨Åg-
ured two setups to extract features for the French
dataset: 1) Uses English, German and Spanish
classiÔ¨Åers and apply majority voting to get the Ô¨Å-
nal label, 2) Uses only the Spanish classiÔ¨Åer as
French and Spanish are both Romance languages.An Extra Tree classiÔ¨Åer with 1000 and 500 es-
timators was their best classiÔ¨Åer.

Ô¨Åcation task. For each target word, all the char-
acter n-grams of a given length and their frequen-
cies were extracted and the target word was rep-
resented as a ‚Äùbag of n-grams‚Äù. Different lengths
of n-grams such as a combination of 2-gram, 3-
gram, 4-gram, and 5-grams have been experi-
mented with. The experimental results show that
the combinations of 2-gram and 4-gram features
are the best character level n-gram features for the
binary classiÔ¨Åcation task.
For the English datasets, they combined all
the training datasets (N EWS, W IKINEWS , and
WIKIPEDIA ), used 3-gram, 4-gram and 5-gram
character level n-gram features in order to max-
imize performance. The results show that char-
acter level n-gram features do not work well for
cross-language complex word identiÔ¨Åcation as the
performance generally degraded.
For English, two variants of results were sub-
mitted, one classiÔ¨Åed using the corresponding in-
domain training corpus and the second one classi-
Ô¨Åed using the concatenated training data. For Ger-
man and Spanish, one result was submitted using
the corresponding training data sets. For French,
four submissions were made 1) one classiÔ¨Åed with
English Wikipedia training, 2) one classiÔ¨Åed with
all three English datasets, 3) one classiÔ¨Åed with
Spanish data, and 4) one classiÔ¨Åed with German
data.
NILC present systems (Hartmann and dos San-
tos, 2018) for the monolingual binary and prob-
abilistic classiÔ¨Åcation tasks. Three approaches
were created by 1) using traditional feature
engineering-based machine learning methods, 2)
using the average embedding of target words as
an input to a neural network, and 3) modeling the
context of the target words using an LSTM.
For the feature engineering-based systems, fea-
tures such as linguistic, psycholinguistic, and lan-
guage model features were used to train different
binary and probabilistic classiÔ¨Åers. Lexical fea-
tures include word length, number of syllables,
and number of senses, hypernyms, and hyponyms
in WordNet. For N-gram features, probabilities
of the n-gram containing the target words werecomputed based on language models trained on
the BookCorpus dataset and One Billion Word
dataset. Furthermore, psycholinguistic features
such as familiarity, age of acquisition, correctness
and imagery values were used. Based on these
features (38 in total), models were trained using
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision
Trees, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, AdaBoost,
and XGBoost classiÔ¨Åers.
For embedding-based systems, a pre-trained
GloVe model (Pennington et al., 2014) was used
to get the vector representations of target words.
For MWE, the average of the vectors is used. In
the Ô¨Årst approach, the resulting vector is passed on
to a neural network with two ReLu layers followed
by a sigmoid layer, which predicted the probabil-
ity of the target word being complex.
Their experiments show that the feature engi-
neering approach achieved the best results using
the XGBoost classiÔ¨Åer for the binary classiÔ¨Åca-
tion task. They submitted four systems using XG-
Boost, average embeddings, LSTMs with trans-
fer learning, and a voting system that combines
the other three. For the probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation
task, their LSTMs achieve the best results.
TMU submitted multilingual and cross-lingual
CWI systems for both of the binary and probabilis-
tic classiÔ¨Åcation tasks (Kajiwara and Komachi,
2018). The systems use two variants of frequency
features from the learner corpus ( Lang-8 corpus )
from Mizumoto et al. (2011) and from the general
domain corpus (Wikipedia and WikiNews). The
list of features used in building the model include
the number of characters in the target word, num-
ber of words in the target phrase, and frequency
of the target word in learner corpus (Lang-8 cor-
pus) and general domain corpus (Wikipedia and
WikiNews).
Random forest classiÔ¨Åers are used for the binary
classiÔ¨Åcation task while random forest regressors
are used for the probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation task us-
ing the scikit-learn library. Feature ablation shows
that both the length, frequency, and probability
features (based on corpus statistics) are important
for the binary and probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation tasks.
They also discover that features obtained from the
learner corpus are more inÔ¨Çuential than the general
domain features for the CWI tasks. The systems
perform very well both for the binary and proba-
bilistic classiÔ¨Åcation tasks, winning 5 out of the 12
tracks.ITEC addresses both the binary and probabilis-
tic classiÔ¨Åcation task for the English and Spanish
multilingual datasets (De Hertog and Tack, 2018).
They have used 5 different aspects of the target
word in the process of feature extractions, namely,
word embedding, morphological structure, psy-
chological measures, corpus counts, and topi-
cal information. Psychological measures are ob-
tained from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database,
which includes age of acquisition, imageability,
concreteness, and meaningfulness of the target
word. Word frequencies and embedding features
are computed based on a web corpus. The word
embedding model is computed using the gensim
implementation of word2vec, with 300 dimen-
sional embedding space, window-size of 5 and
minimum frequency threshold of 20.
They have employed deep learning structure us-
ing the keras deep learning library with the ten-
sorÔ¨Çow gpu as a backend. Word embeddings are
employed in two input layers, Ô¨Årst to replace tar-
get words with the appropriate embeddings and
second to represent the entire sentences as an in-
put sequence which is considered the topical ap-
proximation using contextual cues. The Ô¨Ånal layer
takes into account morphological features based
on character embeddings that are trained with a
convolutional network. The systems perform rea-
sonably better than the average systems, for both
of the binary and probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation tasks.
Camb describes different systems (Gooding
and Kochmar, 2018) they have developed for the
monolingual English datasets both for the binary
and probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation tasks. They have
used features that are based on the insights of
the CWI shared task 2016 (Paetzold and Spe-
cia, 2016a) such as lexical features (word length,
number of syllables, WordNet features such as
the number of synsets), word n-gram and POS
tags, and dependency parse relations. In addi-
tion, they have used features such as the num-
ber of words grammatically related to the target
word, psycholinguistic features from the MRC
database, CEFR (Common European Framework
of Reference for Languages) levels extracted
from the Cambridge Advanced Learner Dictio-
nary (CALD), and Google N-gram word frequen-
cies using the Datamuse API The MCR fea-
tures include word familiarity rating, number of
phonemes, thorndike-lorge written frequency, im-
ageability rating, concreteness rating, number ofcategories, samples, and written frequencies, and
age of acquisition.
For the binary classiÔ¨Åcation task, they have used
a feature union pipeline to combine the range
of heterogeneous features extracted from differ-
ent categories of feature types. The best perform-
ing classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms are obtained based on
the ensemble techniques where AdaBoost classi-
Ô¨Åer with 5000 estimators achieves the highest re-
sults, followed by the bootstrap aggregation clas-
siÔ¨Åer of Random Forest. All the features are used
for the N EWS and W IKINEWS datasets, but for the
WIKIPEDIA dataset, MCR psycholinguistic fea-
tures are excluded. For the probabilistic classiÔ¨Å-
cation task, the same feature setups are used and
the Linear Regression algorithm is used to esti-
mate values of targets.
As it can be seen from Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9,
most of the systems submitted ranked Ô¨Årst for En-
glish monolingual binary and probabilistic classi-
Ô¨Åcation tasks.
CoastalCPH describe systems developed for
multilingual and cross-lingual domains for the bi-
nary and probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation tasks (Bingel
and Bjerva, 2018). Unlike most systems, they have
focused mainly on German, Spanish, and French
datasets in order to investigate if multitask learn-
ing can be applied to the cross-lingual CWI task.
They have devised two models, using language-
agnostic approach with an ensemble that com-
prises of Random Forests (random forest classi-
Ô¨Åers for the binary classiÔ¨Åcation task and random
forest regressors for the probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation
tasks, with 100 trees) and feed-forward neural net-
works.
Most of the features are similar for all languages
except some of them are language-speciÔ¨Åc fea-
tures. The set of features incorporated include
1) log-probability features: unigram frequen-
cies as a log-probabilities from language-speciÔ¨Åc
Wikipedia dumps computed using KenLM, char-
acter perplexity, number of synsets, hypernym
chain. 2) InÔ¨Çectional complexity: number of suf-
Ô¨Åxes appended to a word stem. 3) Surface fea-
tures: length of the target and lower-case informa-
tion. 4) Bag-of-POS: for each tag based on Uni-
versal Parts-of-Speech project, count the number
of words in a candidate that belong to the respec-
tive class. 5) Target-sentence similarity: the cosine
similarity between averaged word embeddings for
the target word or phrase and the rest of the wordsNews MAE Rank WikiNews MAE Rank Wikipedia MAE Rank

in the sentence where out-of-vocabulary problems
are addressed using a pre-trained sub-word em-
beddings (Heinzerling and Strube, 2017).
They have made qualitative and quantitative er-
ror analysis, mainly for the cross-lingual French
dataset experiments and reported that: 1) The sys-
tem picks longer targets as positive examples. 2)
Short targets are predicted as false negative but
they are potentially unknown named entities and
technical terms. 3) Complex words are generally
longer than simple words. 4) Language models
produce lower log-probability for complex words.
The systems submitted performed the best out
of all systems for the cross-lingual task (the
French dataset) both for the binary and probabilis-
tic classiÔ¨Åcation tasks, showing a promising direc-
tion in the creation of CWI dataset for new lan-
guages.LaSTUS/TALN present systems for the
monolingual English binary classiÔ¨Åcation task
(AbuRa‚Äôed and Saggion, 2018). Two different
systems are designed, the Ô¨Årst system is based on
a set of lexical, semantic and contextual features,
and the second system incorporates word embed-
ding features. The word embedding features are
obtained from a pre-trained word2vec model1.
For each sentence, the centroid of the dimen-
sions of the context before the target word, the
target word itself, and the context after the tar-
get word are computed using word2vec embed-
ding vectors (300 dimensions each), resulting in
a total of 900 feature dimensions. Furthermore,
two extra features are generated using the embed-
ding vectors, which represent the distance between
1https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/the target word and the context before and after
the target word respectively. These features are
computed using the cosine similarity measures be-
tween each pair of the vectors.
A large set of shallow lexical and semantic fea-
tures are also used in addition to the embedding
features. These features include target word length
(number of characters), the position of the tar-
get word in the sentence, number of words in
the sentence, word depth in the dependency tree,
parent word length in dependency relation, fre-
quency features based on the BNC, Wikipedia, and
Dale and Chall list corpora, number of synsets and
senses in WordNet, and so on.
The experiment is conducted using the Weka
machine learning framework using the Support
vector machine (with linear and radial basis func-
tion kernels), Na ¬®ƒ±ve Bayes, Logistic Regression,
Random Tree, and Random Forest classiÔ¨Åcation
algorithms. The Ô¨Ånal experiments employ Support
Vector Machines and Random Forest classiÔ¨Åers.
CFILT IITB Developed ensemble-based clas-
siÔ¨Åcation systems for the English monolingual bi-
nary classiÔ¨Åcation task (Wani et al., 2018). Lexi-
cal features based on WordNet for the target word
are extracted as follows: 1) Degree of Polysemy:
number of senses of the target word in WordNet,
2) Hyponym and Hypernym Tree Depth: the po-
sition of the word in WordNet‚Äôs hierarchical tree,
and 3) Holonym and Meronym Counts: based on
the relationship of the target word to its compo-
nents (meronyms) or to the things it is contained
in (Holonym‚Äôs). Additional feature classes include
size-based features such as word count, word
length, vowel counts, and syllable counts. They
also use vocabulary-based features such as Ogden
Basic (from Ogden‚Äôs Basic Word list), Ogden Fre-
quency (Ogden‚Äôs Frequent Word List), and Bar-
ron‚Äôs Wordlist (Barron‚Äôs 5000 GRE Word List).
They have used 8 classiÔ¨Åers namely Random
Forest, Random Tree, REP Tree, Logistic Model
Tree, J48 Decision Tree, JRip Rules Tree, PART,
and SVM. Using these classiÔ¨Åers, a hard voting
approach is used to predict a label for the target
word. V oting of the positive or negative class is
decided if more than 4 classiÔ¨Åers agree on the la-
bel. Word-embedding-based classiÔ¨Åer is used to
decide in the case of a 4-4 tie.
An ablation test shows that size-based features
such as word length, vowel counts, and syllable
counts, word counts constitute the four top impor-tant features. Their best system shows an aver-
age performance compared to the other systems in
the shared task for the monolingual English binary
classiÔ¨Åcation track.
NLP-CIC present systems for the English and
Spanish multilingual binary classiÔ¨Åcation tasks
(Aroyehun et al., 2018). The feature sets include
morphological features such as frequency counts
of target word on large corpora such as Wikipedia
and Simple Wikipedia, syntactic and lexical fea-
tures, psycholinguistic features from the MRC
psycholinguistic database and entity features using
the OpenNLP and CoreNLP tools, and word em-
bedding distance as a feature which is computed
between the target word and the sentence.
Tree learners such as Random Forest, Gradient
Boosted, and Tree Ensembles are used to train dif-
ferent classiÔ¨Åers. Furthermore, a deep learning
approach based on 2D convolutional (CNN) and
word embedding representations of the target text
and its context is employed.
Their best system ranked 10th, 5th, and 16thfor
the N EWS, W IKINEWS, and W IKIPEDIA mono-
lingual English tracks, which is better than the
average systems in the shared task. The system
based on the CNN model on the Spanish monolin-
gual dataset ranked 2nd.
5 Conclusions
This paper presented the results and Ô¨Åndings of the
second CWI shared task. Thirty teams enrolled to
participate in the competition and 12 of them sub-
mitted their results. Subsequently, 11 teams wrote
system description papers that have been reviewed
in this report.
Overall, traditional feature engineering-based
approaches (mostly based on length and frequency
features) perform better than neural network and
word embedding-based approaches. However,
compared to the SemEval 2016 Task 11 shared
task systems presented in Table 1, we have ob-
served that more systems employed deep learning
approaches and the results are getting better for the
CWI task; the difference is less pronounced for the
probabilistic classiÔ¨Åcation tasks.
One of our most important Ô¨Åndings is that cross-
lingual experimental results are very promising,
which we think implies in fundamental progress
for CWI research. Despite the fact that we do
not provide a training dataset for French, the re-
sults obtained have superior or equivalent scores(though they of course cannot be directly com-
pared) to the German and Spanish datasets, when
the system uses either one or several training
datasets from the other languages.
