Abstract
The release of ChatGPT, a language model capable of generating text that appears
human-like and authentic, has gained signiﬁcant attention beyond the research
community. We expect that the convincing performance of ChatGPT incentivizes
users to apply it to a variety of downstream tasks, including prompting the model to
simplify their own medical reports. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted
an exploratory case study. In a questionnaire, we asked 15 radiologists to assess the
quality of radiology reports simpliﬁed by ChatGPT. Most radiologists agreed that
the simpliﬁed reports were factually correct, complete, and not potentially harmful
to the patient. Nevertheless, instances of incorrect statements, missed key medical
ﬁndings, and potentially harmful passages were reported. While further studies
are needed, the initial insights of this study indicate a great potential in using large
language models like ChatGPT to improve patient-centered care in radiology and
other medical domains.
1 Introduction
"ChatGPT, am I dying? What does this medical report mean? Can you explain it to me like I’m
ﬁve?" With the latest release of OpenAI’s Large Language Model (LLM) ChatGPT [1], algorithmic
language modeling has reached a new milestone in generating human-like responses to user text
inputs. Just ﬁve days after its release, ChatGPT had already attracted over a million users and gained a
signiﬁcant amount of media attention [2, 3, 4, 5]. Given the level of popularity and widespread access
to the public, the question as to how people will use such models arises and which opportunities and
challenges are associated with them. In our experience, the text output of ChatGPT was astonishingly
convincing for a variety of tasks, such that we expect disruptive change across numerous domains
and industries in a very short time.
Among a myriad of potential downstream applications, LLMs are able to simplify complex text [6] and
subsequently make it more accessible to a broader audience. There is a huge need for simpliﬁcation
in domains where expert knowledge is necessary to put text into context and interpret it. For example,

legal or medical documents are written by trained experts in highly specialized language, but often
have immediate consequences for clients or patients, respectively, who are usually non-experts.
Simplifying these documents promises to enable individuals to actively and autonomously oversee
them. One domain where text simpliﬁcation might be particularly useful is radiology. Radiological
ﬁndings are typically communicated in a free-text report in specialized medical jargon, targeting
a clinician or doctor as the recipient. For readers without a medical background, these reports are
often inaccessible and potentially misleading. For example, a study [7] showed, that only 4% of all
analyzed radiology reports were readable by the average US adult. They concluded to use simpler
and more structured language to improve patient-centered care.
Ideally, radiological ﬁndings are communicated in a timely, personalized conversation between doctor
and patient. However, in resource-constrained health systems, this conversation is often delayed.
Therefore, patients might try to make their radiology reports accessible upfront. For instance, patients
might research isolated medical terms on the internet without being able to place them in the correct
medical context, potentially leading to misinterpretations and confusion. In this context, [8] developed
an online system that augments radiology reports with lay-language deﬁnitions. Alternatively, patients
might use free simpliﬁcation services1, which often lack popularity, accessibility, or scalability. We
expect, that in the very near future, publicly accessible LLMs such as ChatGPT will increasingly be
applied by interested patients to simplify their own medical reports ﬁlling the gap.
However, ChatGPT was not explicitly trained for medical text simpliﬁcation and is not intended to be
used for this critical task. While it can generate plausible-sounding text, the content does not need to
be true, as shown in Figure 1. This raises the question of whether LLMs such as ChatGPT are able
to simplify radiology reports such that the output is factually correct, complete, and not potentially
harmful to the patient. Patients, i.e., potential LLM users, are not able to answer this question. The
quality of these simpliﬁed reports needs to be thoroughly assessed by expert radiologists.
In this work, we conducted an exploratory case study to investigate the phenomenon that emerging
LLMs such as ChatGPT may be used or misused by patients to simplify their radiology reports. This
unintended use may raise chances and challenges for patient-centered care. Therefore, we asked
15 radiologists to rate the quality of three radiology reports simpliﬁed by ChatGPT regarding their
factual correctness ,completeness , and potential harm using a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and
inductive categories were used to evaluate the questionnaire. Based on our ﬁndings, we elaborated
opportunities and challenges of using ChatGPT-like LLMs for simplifying radiology reports.
2 Background
In this section, we introduce LLMs, as well as the technical speciﬁcs of ChatGPT. We shortly discuss
techniques for summarization and simpliﬁcation of radiology reports and mention known limitations
of LMMs. This will serve as a basis for discussing chances and potential challenges for a scenario
where these models are used to simplify radiology reports by patients.

22.1 Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing
Since introducing the concept of attention in deep learning models [9], the transformer is an estab-
lished architecture with dominance in nearly all natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks,
including question answering, translation, and text classiﬁcation [10]. While the base-model architec-
ture remained relatively unchanged throughout the years, signiﬁcant progress was made by scaling the
number of layers and internal dimensions resulting in so-called Large Language Models (LLMs) with
billions of parameters, which lead to increased model capacity and abilities. Popular architectures
grew in parameter size starting, e.g., from BERT (345M; [11]) over MegatronLM (8.3B; [12]) and
T-5 (11B; [13]) up to BLOOM (176B; [14]) and PaLM (540B; [10]). A signiﬁcant success factor
for ﬁtting LLMs is an enormous training dataset, e.g., the Pile [15], which contains documents from
Arxiv, PubMed, Stack Exchange, Wikipedia, as well as a subset of Common Crawl2, and GitHub,
among others. For these kinds of LLMs, [16] introduced the terminology of foundation models ,
which deﬁnes training on a very large data basis and the ability to adapt to a variety of downstream
tasks.
2.2 ChatGPT
ChatGPT is an LLM developed by OpenAI that was ﬁrst released on November 30th, 2022. The
user can directly prompt the model via an API in a conversational way, e.g., allowing for follow-up
questions or admission of mistakes [1]. The backbone of ChatGPT is based on the generative pre-
trained transformer series (GPT; [17, 18, 19]). Despite the success and capacity of the third GPT
iteration (GPT-3) [19] with 175B parameters, the challenge of engineering text prompts for achieving
the desired generative output remained. This is due to the autoregressive training procedure, which
tasks the model to predict a token based on the previous text and thus is optimized for text completion
and not dialogues. To improve the dialogue capabilities of the model as well as to reduce bias and
general toxicity, [20] developed InstructGPT, a ﬁne-tuned GPT-3, that leverages a novel training
procedure in order to follow user instructions more persistently. The basic idea for InstructGPT is
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF, [21]), which is composed of three phases: First,
human labelers manually create responses for randomly sampled prompts from a prompt database.
This handcrafted data served to ﬁne-tune GPT-3 in a supervised fashion (SFT model), i.e., through
training on the manually created output for the respective prompt. In the second step, SFT is tasked to
create multiple outputs for a given prompt, which are subsequently ranked by a human labeler from
best to worst. This new ranking dataset serves to train a reward model, which assigns a scalar reward
as a measure of quality for the given SFT outputs. In the ﬁnal step, concepts from reinforcement
learning and proximal policy optimization [22] were applied to ﬁne-tune SFT using a previously
trained reward model as an approximate reward function. This allows evaluation of the quality of the
online-generated outputs using the reward model.
The setups of training InstructGPT and ChatGPT are nearly identical with minor differences concern-
ing the data collection [1]. The major difference lies in the backbone itself. InstructGPT is based
on GPT-3. ChatGPT uses GPT-3.5, a newer, iterated version of the original GPT-3. Additionally,
OpenAI embedded various non-disclosed safety mechanisms into ChatGPT to promote a secure and
non-toxic environment.
2.3 Simpliﬁcation and Summarization of Radiology Reports
Despite being closely related, simpliﬁcation and summarization express two different concepts. Text
summarization describes the task of creating a short version of a text including all important aspects.
A supervised recurrent model for this domain was proposed by [23] with increased performance
in comparison to previous non-neural approaches. [24] noted a lack of medical terminology in
BERT and therefore proposed ﬁne-tuning the model on chest x-ray reports before summarizing
impression sections. A domain adaption was done by [25] for a German version of BERT with the
goal of summarizing German chest x-ray reports. Further approaches for abstractive summarization
employed, e.g., a pointer-generator network [26] or a reinforcement-learning inspired procedure [27]
to solve this task. For extractive summarization of medical data, BioBERT was ﬁne-tuned by [28] and
a sentence-ranking framework with random forests in the backbone was proposed by [29]. Overall,
[30] argued that the continuously growing availability of biomedical text data has led to increased
2http://commoncrawl.org/
3attention to the research ﬁeld of text summarization, where meanwhile the majority of methods focus
on machine learning.
In contrast to summarization, simplifying a text does not necessarily imply shortening, but describes
a transformation to make it more readable and understandable [31, 32]. For instance, [33] identiﬁed
a considerate proportion of recurring standard phrases in their radiology report dataset and argued
that these could be easily and consistently replaced with simpler terminology, while more varied
descriptions of unique pathological ﬁndings were less easy to simplify automatically. A similar
procedure was applied in [34], where human evaluators report a simpliﬁcation of the medical reports
after the substitution. The replacement method was also adapted and extended by a semantic network
in [35]. The open-access consumer health vocabulary (CHV) was used by [36] for simplifying text.
They came to the conclusion that even some CHV terms may not be appropriate for laypersons.
In addition to this technical work on how to generate simpliﬁed reports, studies were conducted
to investigate how well patients can understand conventional radiology reports, and if they prefer
simpliﬁed reports. Using readability tests, [37] showed that the required reading level for their set of
lumbar spine reports exceeded 12thgrade. They argued that the patients’ understanding of complex
texts should be considered since patients increasingly read reports themselves. As mentioned in
the introduction, [7] concluded that only 4% of more than 100,000 consecutive radiology reports
were at a reading level below the reading level of an average US adult. This ﬁnding was further
investigated in a randomized controlled trial [38], where the majority of patients showed a preference
for patient-friendly radiology reports over traditional radiology reports.
There is a clear need for patients to be able to better understand radiology reports [7]. While machine
learning has made signiﬁcant progress in the area of radiology report summarization, to the best
of our knowledge, automated report simpliﬁcation has not yet received adequate attention within
the NLP community. ChatGPT and other foundation models present promising opportunities for
simplifying radiology reports, but it is important to consider their limitations, particularly when used
in the medical ﬁeld.
2.4 Known Limitations of LLMs
The GPT-3 publication [19] discussed the potential for misuse since the generated outputs become
close to indistinguishable from human language. Furthermore, they highlighted model-inherent issues
with biases and fairness. Access to GPT is only granted over an API and not to the original model.
With an effort to democratize artiﬁcial intelligence, EleutherAI published GPT-J as an open-source
alternative for GPT-3 [39]. [16] also elaborated on intrinsic biases, which are inherent to foundation
models. In addition, they brought up the concept of extrinsic harms that occur by adaption to a
downstream task. Moreover, the aspect of centralization of power was mentioned as a problem,
where only a speciﬁc part of society is able to access tools like an LLM. [40] critically discussed the
aspect of training data being one source of harmful and biased behavior of LLMs and depicted the
ﬁnancial as well as environmental impacts of large model training. Additionally, [41] were able to
extract potentially sensitive training data from LLMs, indicating that larger models tend to be more
vulnerable to these attacks due to increased memorization. Another important issue is that LLMs can
produce a text which sounds plausible to the reader but is incorrect or nonsensical. In a benchmark
to measure truthful answers, larger models tended to score lower than their smaller versions with
fewer parameters [42]. Recently, Meta launched the Galactica LLM [43] to support scientiﬁc writing.
However, the API was taken ofﬂine three days after its release due to a backlash: The model produced
seemingly correct-sounding but factually incorrect articles.
When using ChatGPT to simplify radiology reports, we expect the output to sound plausible, while its
factual correctness and completeness are not guaranteed. In the next chapter, we present our approach
for assessing the quality of ChatGPT-generated simpliﬁed reports.
3 Methods
To investigate the capabilities of ChatGPT for simpliﬁcation of radiology reports, we conducted an
exploratory case study (Figure 2) based on the research question: What is the radiologists’ opinion on
the quality of simpliﬁed radiology reports generated with ChatGPT? We designed a questionnaire that
included three ﬁctitious original radiology reports written by an experienced radiologist and a unique
4Figure 2: Summary of our evaluation pipeline. ChatGPT is prompted to generate multiple simpliﬁed
reports. Radiologists are then tasked to assess their quality in a questionnaire. Lastly, the obtained
data is evaluated.
simpliﬁed version of each generated by ChatGPT. We asked 15 radiologists to rate the simpliﬁed
reports and analyzed the results of the questionnaire.
3.1 Original Radiology Reports
A radiologist with 10 years of experience wrote three artiﬁcial radiology reports. The artiﬁcial reports
did not contain any sensitive personalized information. Each report contains multiple ﬁndings, which
are associated with one another, e.g. tumor with edema, meniscus lesion with cruciate ligament lesion,
and systemic metastasis. All three reports are of moderate complexity, based on a deﬁnition, where a
report is of low complexity in case it contains no pathological or at most one explicit pathological
ﬁnding, and of high complexity in case of many and especially unclear ﬁndings. The ﬁctitious reports
mimic real cases in clinical routine, i.e., the reports include previous medical information, describe
the ﬁndings on the image, and contain a conclusion.
The ﬁrst report Knee MRI (A.1.0) describes a case in musculoskeletal radiology. The case of a
neuroradiological MRI of the brain is the subject of the second report Head MRI (A.2.0). It describes
a follow-up examination and mentions comparisons to the previous examinations. The third report
(A.3.0), referred to as Oncol. CT , describes a ﬁctitious oncological imaging event, reporting a
follow-up whole-body CT scan. To give an impression of the complex wordings in radiology reports,
some excerpts of the original reports are shown in Figure 3.

3.2 Simplifying Reports using ChatGPT
The original radiology reports were simpliﬁed by prompting the ChatGPT (version December 15th,
2022) online interface with the request "Explain this medical report to a child using simple language:"
followed by the original radiology report in text format.
This prompt was derived in a heuristic fashion using a separate ﬁctitious radiology report that was
different from the original reports described in Section 3.1. First, we tested different prompt versions
of different lengths and compositions, including "Simplify", "Explain like I’m ﬁve", "Explain this
medical report like I’m ﬁve", "Explain to a child using simple language", "Explain this medical report
5using simple language", and "Explain this medical report to a child using simple language". Based
on several trials, we gained the impression that the latter prompt produced the best and most stable
results and we perceived the language of the generated reports to be signiﬁcantly simpler compared
to the original report. We assume that this might be traced back to its detailed and explicit form,
containing a concise call to action ("Explain"), specifying a narrow domain ("medical report"), and
asking for a speciﬁc level of language complexity ("to a child using simple language"). During our
tests, including phrases like "to a child" or "like I’m ﬁve" in the prompt on top of "simplify" or "using
simple language" appeared to be beneﬁcial for language simpliﬁcation. While our ﬁnal prompt choice
"Explain this medical report to a child using simple language" worked well for our radiology report
examples in this study, we do not claim that this version is necessarily the best option for the task of
simplifying radiology report with ChatGPT.
The output of ChatGPT is not deterministic by default. In principle, the model outputs probabilities
for the next token in the autoregressive generation procedure. However, the current settings of
the ChatGPT interface do not allow tuning the temperature parameter responsible for handling the
predicted token probabilities. To account for the variability in the text output of ChatGPT and to
achieve good coverage of its generative capability, we prompted the model 15 times for each of
the three original reports, respectively, i.e., we generated 15 different simpliﬁed reports per original
report. Before each repeat of the prompt, we restarted the chat session to ensure that no tokens in
the cache could distort the generated response. All 45 ChatGPT-generated simpliﬁed reports can be
found in Appendix A.
3.3 Questionnaire
We designed a questionnaire to query radiologists on the quality of the simpliﬁed reports generated
with ChatGPT. We deﬁned the quality of radiology reports as the combination of (i) factual correct-
ness, (ii) completeness , and (iii) harmfulness .Factual correctness was not further speciﬁed. By our
deﬁnition, a complete report includes all key medical information, relevant to the patient. We specify
harm as the potential that a subject could draw wrong conclusions from a simpliﬁcation, which might
result in any physical or psychological harm or lead to unwanted change in therapy or compliance.
The anonymized questionnaire "Questionnaire - Quality of Simpliﬁed Radiological Reports" (Ap-
pendix B.1) consisted of the three original radiology reports (section 3.1) and three unique simpliﬁed
reports created with ChatGPT, respectively (section 3.2). On the front page, the participating radiolo-
gists were explicitly informed that the simpliﬁed radiology reports were generated with "the machine
learning language model ChatGPT" and received a description of the setup of the questionnaire
and an instruction on how to answer. Further, we asked for consent to participate and the years of
experience, starting from the ﬁrst year of residency.
Each questionnaire contained three blocks: (i) the original report, (ii) a single, randomly selected,
unique simpliﬁed version of the original report, referred to as a "simpliﬁed report", and (iii) a
series of questions to access the quality of the simpliﬁed reports. We asked the participants to rate
their level of agreement with each criterion on a ﬁve-point Likert scale (formulated as a statement,
respectively). Additionally, each question was accompanied by a follow-up question in which we
asked the radiologists to provide text evidence for their assessment.
• Factual Correctness: "The simpliﬁed radiological report is factually correct."
Follow-up: "Highlight all incorrect text passages (if applicable) of the simpliﬁed report with
a text marker".
•Completeness: "Relevant medical information for the patient is included in the simpliﬁed
radiological report."
Follow-up: "List all relevant medical information, which is missing in the simpliﬁed report
(if applicable)."
•Potential Harm: "The simpliﬁed report leads patients to draw wrong conclusions, which
might result in physical and/or psychological harm."
Follow-up: "List all potentially harmful conclusions, which might be drawn from the
simpliﬁed report (if applicable)."
15 radiologists with varying levels of experience from our clinic (Department of Radiology, University
Hospital, LMU Munich) were asked to answer our questionnaire independently. Each radiologist
received the same three original reports and different, unique simpliﬁed reports.
63.4 Evaluation
The questionnaires were collected and checked for consent and completeness. For each participant,
the years of experience were recorded, respectively. The radiologists’ ratings on the Likert Scales
for factual correctness, completeness, and potential harm were evaluated for each of the three cases
(Knee MRI ,Brain MRI ,Oncol. CT ). Statistical parameters for the ordinal scales were calculated:
median, 25%-quantile ( Q1), 75%-quantile ( Q3), interquartile range (IQR), minimum, maximum,
mean, and standard deviation (SD). The word count for the original reports and each simpliﬁed report
was noted. For each report, all passages of the highlighted text, as well as answers in the free-text
ﬁelds were transcribed manually to a spreadsheet (Table 5). Additionally, the percentage of free-text
questions and text highlights where text evidence was provided by the participants was calculated.
Finally, the free-text answers were inductively categorized by content.
4 Results
In this section, we present our evaluation of the questionnaires, which were answered by 15 radiolo-
gists with a median (IQR) experience of 5 (9) years. We analyzed their ratings on the Likert Scale,
followed by the free-text analysis and the word count of the reports.
4.1 Likert Scale Analysis
We ﬁrst evaluated the radiologists’ ratings for all 45 simpliﬁed reports (see Table 1 and Figure 4a).
The participants generally agreed (median = 2) with the statements that the simpliﬁed reports are
factually correct andcomplete , respectively. For both quality criteria, 75% of all ratings were given
for "Agree" or "Fully agree" ( Q3= 2), while "Fully disagree" was not selected at all. In the case
ofcompleteness , we found a slight tendency towards more positive ratings compared to factual
correctness . 25% of all completeness ratings were "Fully agree" ( Q1= 1), more than for factual
correctness . Further, "Neutral" and "Disagree" were only selected four times, but were selected ten
times for factual correctness . Accordingly, the mean is slightly lower (closer to 1 = Fully agree)
forcompleteness (mean = 1.8) compared to factual correctness (mean = 2.2). In line with these
ﬁndings, the participants disagreed (median = 4) on the potential of wrong conclusions drawn from the
simpliﬁed reports resulting in physical and/or psychological harm. Compared to factual correctness

In the second step, we also evaluated the radiologists’ ratings for each of the three cases ( Knee MRI ,
Brain MRI , and Oncol. CT ) individually. The results of the three reports are illustrated in Figure 4b
and summarized in Table 2. The median of the ratings showed no relevant differences in factual
correctness ,completeness , and potential harm . However, there is a tendency that the Head MRI and
theOncol. CT reports are judged to have a higher risk of patients drawing wrong conclusions with
potentially harmful consequences.

4.2 Free-text Analysis
In the following, we summarize the results of the follow-up questions. For each follow-up question,
we applied inductive categorization of the free-text data by content. We present the identiﬁed
categories along with a few selected examples for each. 51% of the participants highlighted incorrect
passages, while only 22% and 36% of the radiologists listed missing relevant information and
potentially harmful conclusions, respectively (Table 3).

the participants.
84.2.1 Highlights of Incorrect Text Passages
We asked the participants to mark incorrect passages in the text (see highlighted passages in the
simpliﬁed texts in Appendix A), which unveiled a variety of weak points in the simpliﬁed reports of
ChatGPT.
Misinterpretation of medical terms We observed that in the simpliﬁed text generated by ChatGPT
medical terminology was misinterpreted in several cases. The abbreviation "DD" (differential
diagnosis) was often mistaken as a ﬁnal diagnosis (A.2.6, A.2.8), e.g., the simpliﬁed report contains
"The conclusion of the report is that the mass on the right side of the head is a type of cancer called
a glioblastoma [:::]" for the original statement " [:::]DD distant GBM manifestation". Furthermore,
"thyroid struma" was described by ChatGPT in one instance as "infection in their thyroid gland"
(A.3.13) and in another as "extra thyroid gland" (A.3.7). The ﬁnding "No pneumothorax" was
described as "no holes in the walls between the lungs and chest" (A.3.3). The lateral compartment of
the knee was described as being on the "part of your body that’s on the outside" (A.1.15). The term
"retroperitoneal" (referring to lymph nodes in need of further control) was wrongly interpreted as
"in the person’s back" (A.3.9). Lastly, a growing mass of "currently max. 22 mm" was incorrectly
simpliﬁed as a "small, abnormal growth [:::]that has gotten bigger" (A.2.3).
Imprecise language In some cases we observed that the automated simpliﬁcation led to passages
of imprecise language: The medial compartment of the knee was described as the "middle part
of your leg" (A.1.5), the brain as the "head" (A.2.7), the abdomen as the "stomach" (A.3.7) and
thyroid struma as "thyroid problems" (A.3.12). Partial regression was described as "gotten smaller
and is not spreading as much as before" (A.3.12), intercondylar area as "the area between the two
bones that make up the lower part of the leg" (A.1.4) and cartilage was described as "hard, smooth
substance" (A.1.9). Metastases were imprecisely simpliﬁed as "spots" (A.3.5). A case of ambiguous
simpliﬁcation of the original text is found where the simple report ended with " [:::]is no evidence of
the cancer spreading to other parts of the body." (A.3.13). In the original report pulmonary metastases
were described.
Hallucination Some ﬁndings were not contained in the original report, i.e. they were made up in
the simpliﬁed reports, for instance, "no signs of cancer [:::]in the thyroid gland" (A.3.3) or "brain
does not seem to be damaged" (A.2.9).
Odd language We observed odd and unsuited language in several simpliﬁed reports. The idiom
"wear and tear" (A.1.4) was used to describe the degeneration of tendons and a radiological examina-
tion was circumscribed as "to see how the cancer is doing" (A.3.8). In report A.2.6 contrast media
was paraphrased with the word "dye" and tumor as a "group of abnormal cells".
Grammatical errors Grammatical errors such as "CT scan" instead of "CT scanner" (A.3.7) were
the exception.
4.2.2 Missing Key Medical Information
Furthermore, the simpliﬁed reports often missed key medical ﬁndings mentioned in the original
report.
Missed ﬁndings ForKnee MRI (A.1.0), a participant noted that the information on cartilage damage
on the inner side of the knee was missing in the simpliﬁed report (A.1.5). In the Head MRI report
(A.2.0) the information on "no intermediate or recent ischemia" (A.2.2) was missing in one instance.
Another missed ﬁnding was the growth of the lesion on the parietooccipital side in the conclusion
of the simpliﬁed report (A.2.4). For Oncol. CT (A.3.0) one participant reported that mentioning
"spots" in contrast to metastases removes medical information. Furthermore the fact, that the solid
portions of the pulmonary metastases are decreasing (A.3.5) - consistent with therapy response - is
not included in the simpliﬁed report. In another simpliﬁed report (A.3.13), where the thyroid struma
is misinterpreted as infection, the description of the enlargement is missing.
Unspeciﬁc location We observed missing or unspeciﬁc location information in the simpliﬁed
reports. In the simpliﬁed report A.1.15 the location of the described ﬁnding (knee) was not mentioned.
9A participant mentioned that "the back" (A.3.14) is not precise enough to describe the affected
retroperitoneum. Non-speciﬁc descriptions of the location resulted in problems with the identiﬁcation
of the present tumor and the excised tumor (A.2.11).
4.2.3 Potentially Harmful
Finally, we asked the participants to list all potentially harmful conclusions, which might be drawn
from the simpliﬁed report. The given answers corresponded mostly to already highlighted passages
of incorrect text or missing key medical information and corroborated the detected weaknesses. Odd
language and grammatical errors were not considered potentially harmful.
Misinterpretation of medical terms Participants listed the misinterpretation of differential diag-
nosis ("DD") for ﬁnal diagnosis as potentially harmful for the patient, e.g., "GBM is one (likely)
DD which implies that other DDs exist (e.g. radionecrosis)" (A.2.7). Lymph nodes were presented
in the simpliﬁed report like "they might have cancer"(A.3.9). This was considered harmful since
the original report stated that there was "no evidence of recurrence or new lymph node metastases".
Furthermore, the wording "small growth" (A.2.3) was deemed a harmful conclusion, as the original
report Head MRI (A.2.0) states a progression in size, which "almost doubled".
Hallucination Participants assessed the hallucination "brain does not seem to be damaged" (A.2.9)
as potentially harmful to the patient, as the original report describes a growing mass.
Imprecise language We observed that imprecise language highlighted as incorrect was sometimes
also graded as potentially harmful to the patient. One participant noted that "there is no (new)
spread of cancer" in the simpliﬁed oncological report (A.3.13). Additionally, participants listed these
potentially harmful conclusions: "not clear that spots are pulmonal metastasis" (A.3.5), "changes
happened recently (how recently?)", and "some extra ﬂuid 6=sign. incr. edema" (A.2.13).
Missed ﬁndings We found that potentially harmful conclusions can originate from missing infor-
mation in the simpliﬁed report. The sentence "the parts that are staying the same size are changing"
(A.3.5) was found to be an unclear statement missing interpretation. One participant stated that
"information [:::]about the lesion showing growth" is missing from the conclusion of the simpliﬁed
report (A.2.4).
Unspeciﬁc location Cases, where ChatGPT misses the correct information about a location of a
disease, can lead to potentially harmful conclusions. Examples were: "misunderstanding which lesion
is stable and which one is in progress can lead the patient to some wrong expectations" (A.2.11) and
"patient might be misled to look at cancer spots on their back" (A.3.14).
4.3 Word Count
The median word count for the simpliﬁed Head MRI andOncol. CT reports were comparable to their
respective original reports (Table 4). The simpliﬁed Knee MRI report with a median (IQR) word
count of 414 (60) is generally longer compared to the original report (word count = 222).
Report Original Simpliﬁed
Median Min Max IQR
Knee MRI 222 414 249 538 60
Head MRI 117 150 91 241 79
Oncol. CT 241 249 111 386 94

105 Discussion
In this exploratory study, we evaluated the opinion of radiologists on the quality of radiology reports
which were simpliﬁed by ChatGPT. Participating radiologists rated the simpliﬁed radiology reports
according to (i) factual correctness , (ii) completeness , and (iii) potential harmfulness . In the following,
we discuss the implication of our results presented in Section 4.
5.1 Quality of Simpliﬁed Reports Generated with ChatGPT
We prompted ChatGPT to generate 45 simpliﬁed radiology reports for this study. According to the
authors of ChatGPT, the model is in principle able to state to not know the answer [1]. However, in
no instance, the model refused to give an answer or indicated that the response could be incorrect
while generating consistent plausible-sounding outputs.
5.1.1 Factual Correctness
Although ChatGPT was not explicitly trained for the purpose of simplifying radiology reports, most
radiologists agreed that the generated simpliﬁed reports are factually correct (median = 2, Section
4). However, some radiologists also identiﬁed statements that were not considered factually correct
(Figure 4). In particular, we identiﬁed the following error categories: misinterpretation of medical
terms ,imprecise language ,hallucination ,odd language , and grammatical errors .
On the one hand, we speculate that the problem of misinterpretation of medical terms ,imprecise
language ,odd language , and grammatical errors may be solved by the adoption of a ChatGPT-like
model for the medical domain, as well as by optimizing the prompt. On the other hand, we also
observed hallucination , which is a type of behavior where the model adds statements to the simpliﬁed
report that cannot be derived from the original report (Section 4.2.1). This is an intrinsic problem in
generative models like LLMs [44].
5.1.2 Completeness
Prompting ChatGPT for simpliﬁcation is likely to cause responses, where content is removed or
rephrased in oversimpliﬁed terms. Therefore, we tasked radiologists to verify the completeness
of the simpliﬁed reports. Overall, the radiologists agreed that the simpliﬁed reports contained the
medical information relevant for the patients (median = 2, Section 4.1). This indicates that ChatGPT
is able to identify the most important aspects of the complex medical content of radiology reports.
Nevertheless, the participants also detected missing key medical information, which we summarized
in the two categories missed ﬁndings andunspeciﬁc location (Section 4). These ﬁndings suggest that
paraphrasing and explaining complex medical terminology in more simple terms can have the side
effect of losing medical context and professional preciseness.
It is an open question if the problem of missing key medical information could be solved by adapting
the prompt or if this is an unreachable goal for the current version of ChatGPT.
5.1.3 Potential Harm
Non-maleﬁcence, i.e., to not harm individual patients, is a major principle of medical ethics, also
in the context of AI applications [45, 46]. Thus, we asked the radiologists if they think that "The
simpliﬁed report leads patients to draw wrong conclusions, which might result in physical and/or
psychological harm.”
Overall, radiologists disagreed that potentially harmful conclusions will be drawn from the ChatGPT-
generated reports (median = 4, Table 1). This ﬁnding may encourage patients to use ChatGPT
or similar LLMs as a tool to simplify radiology reports. However, as shown in Section 4.2.1 and
4.2.2, simpliﬁed reports can contain errors and key medical ﬁndings might be missed. About half of
the radiologists found critical statements in the simpliﬁed reports with a high potential of leading
patients to wrong conclusions, which bears the great risk of causing physical or psychological harm
(Section 4.2.3). For example, the medical ﬁnding that certain lymph nodes "might have cancer" is
an overstatement in the simpliﬁed report A.3.9. The original report clearly states that there is "No
evidence of recurrence or new lymph node metastases" and only suggests to "further control" the
"Unchanged prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes". This might cause psychological harm since the
11patient could conclude that the CT shows hints of new lymph node metastases. Another example can
be found in the simpliﬁed report A.2.3. Here, only a "small growth" of the contrast-enhancing mass
is described, whereas the original report (A.2.0) states a progression in size, which "almost doubled".
This is a clear understatement, which could lead the patient to underestimate the progression of the
disease.
While, overall, radiologists do not see a high risk for potential harm, they still point out that single
errors occur which might be potentially harmful. Users of ChatGPT should be aware of this problem.
5.2 Opportunities and Challenges
With openly available LLMs like ChatGPT, patients might use these tools to simplify their radiology
reports in the near future. This scenario raises a number of opportunities and challenges.
Patient-centered care Improved accessibility of personal medical information may be beneﬁcial
to the patient in multiple ways. Simpliﬁed reports give patients the chance to better comprehend
their health situation instead of making them feel overwhelmed by the medical terminology found
in the original report and might help patients to better prepare themselves for future doctor-patient
interactions. For instance, the simpliﬁed report might raise questions patients could then ask the
medical practitioner. This might lead to an improved understanding of their own health condition
which, in turn, empowers the patients, strengthens their position throughout the medical treatment,
and facilitates informed patient decisions. Simpliﬁed radiology reports are particularly valuable for
patients who do not speak the native language of the country in which they are treated. Even though
ChatGPT works best for English, other languages are supported with varying quality. In the case of
poorly supported languages, reports could be translated into English using established tools prior to
simpliﬁcation. Overall, easily accessible simpliﬁed radiology reports may help to increase patient
autonomy and allow them to take on a more active role throughout their medical treatment process
facilitating patient-centered care.
However, when patients simplify their reports in advance of a medical consultation, patients will not
be assisted by an expert while reading and attempting to interpret them. Without medical advice,
patients could misinterpret certain ﬁndings or even learn about a life-threatening diagnosis from
their simpliﬁed report, but the information might not be accompanied by additional context, e.g.,
therapy options. This could put the patient in a state of mental stress. Additionally, there might be
an increased risk of patients making their own clinical decisions, such as delaying or even omitting
further doctor appointments or terminating a therapy without professional medical consultation. Even
though the language conveying the information might be simpliﬁed, the content of radiology reports
and the process of clinical decision-making remains complex.
Zero-shot simpliﬁcation of radiology reports In this study, we found that ChatGPT already
performs surprisingly well at simplifying radiology reports out of the box. It produces fairly accurate
and complete simpliﬁed reports. If this technology continues to become even more easily accessible
for laypersons, it has the potential to be applied by a wide range of users in the near future. To fully
leverage this tool as a radiology report simpliﬁer with maximum beneﬁt for patients, several technical
hurdles need to be overcome.
Among others, we see the following challenges: ChatGPT was not developed for the speciﬁc
task of simplifying radiology reports. A domain adaption of ChatGPT to the medical ﬁeld could
further improve the quality of generated simpliﬁed radiology reports, e.g., leading to a more correct
interpretation of medical terms. The task of simpliﬁcation could be enforced by using a reward model
trained to estimate the quality of simpliﬁed radiology reports in the RLHF training procedure of
ChatGPT. Like other LLMs, ChatGPT might have intrinsic biases due to imbalanced training data
[16, 19]. We hypothesize that for the task of simplifying radiology reports, rare pathologies might be
handled less accurately than more common ones. Furthermore, medicine is an active and dynamic
ﬁeld of science, which is subject to progress and change. However, ChatGPT - like most LLMs - is
trained on data with a certain timestamp [40]. New research ﬁndings in medicine are thus not reﬂected
in the model’s output. Another problematic property of ChatGPT is the non-deterministic output.
ChatGPT generates text by predicting tokens on a probabilistic basis, which does not guarantee the
most likely response. While this fosters dynamic dialogue, it could also lead to high variance with
respect to output reliability. As of now, there is no way for users to control ChatGPT, e.g., with a
12temperature parameter or seed. This makes it difﬁcult, if not almost impossible, to reproduce a certain
output, even when applying the same input multiple times. Finally, there are privacy concerns when
sensitive data is uploaded to a proprietary service.
Potential future clinical application Simpliﬁed radiology reports have the potential to increase
patient autonomy during the treatment process. With the release of ChatGPT, patients now have
unprecedented possibilities to automatically generate such simpliﬁed reports themselves. However,
there is an unavoidable risk for patients to draw potentially harmful conclusions from those reports,
when no medical oversight is provided.
We envision a future integration of ChatGPT-like LLMs directly in the clinic or radiology centers. In
this scenario, a simpliﬁed radiology report would always be automatically generated with an LLM
alongside the original report, proofread by a radiologist, and corrected where necessary. Both reports
would then be issued to the patient. We imagine the application of an appropriate LLM that is adapted
to the medical domain, properly certiﬁed, and hosted in a privacy-preserving way, e.g., on-premise. In
our opinion, this would be a cost-efﬁcient way to leverage state-of-the-art technology for improving
patient-centered care.
5.3 Limitations of the Study
The number of original radiology reports (n = 3) and experts (n = 15) for assessing the quality of the
simpliﬁed reports is small. Further, we used ﬁctitious radiology reports written by an experienced
radiologist instead of original reports of patients to protect patient privacy. The radiologist who
generated the simpliﬁed reports is German, i.e., not a native English speaker. A German abbreviation
("Z.n." for "Zustand nach", which can be paraphrased as "following"), which does not exist in
English, was found in the original reports. The original reports used in this study are at a medium
complexity level. It is unclear how the quality of less or more complex reports would be rated. Also,
the language simplicity of ChatGPT-generated radiology reports was analyzed only qualitatively
during the design process of the input prompt ("Explain this medical report to a child using simple
language"). We did not further investigate the ability of ChatGPT to simplify language with respect
to established guidelines for simple language. We do not claim that our prompt for triggering a
simpliﬁcation of radiology reports through ChatGPT, is optimal for this task. Our prompt is the result
of a heuristic evaluation of experimenting with different inputs. Finally, the quality of the simpliﬁed
reports generated with ChatGPT was only evaluated from a radiologist’s point of view. The patients’
perspective on the readability, accessibility, and added value of those simpliﬁed reports was not part
of this study.
6 Conclusion
In this case study, we asked radiologists to assess the quality of simpliﬁed radiology reports generated
with ChatGPT. We found that most radiologists agree that the simpliﬁed reports are factually correct,
complete, and not potentially harmful to patients. This positive vote illustrates the great potential
that LLMs could have for medical text simpliﬁcation. In particular, we argue that simpliﬁed reports
generated with LLMs like ChatGPT would strengthen patients’ autonomy. However, the radiologists
also identiﬁed factual incorrect statements, missing key medical information, and text passages,
which might lead patients to draw potentially harmful conclusions from the simpliﬁed reports, if
physicians are not kept in the loop. We hypothesize that LLMs like ChatGPT may be used by patients
to simplify radiology reports that contain critical medical information, even though the models were
not developed for this speciﬁc medical use case. Thus, we see a need for technical improvements and
ﬁne-tuning of ChatGPT or similar LLMs to the speciﬁc task of simplifying radiology reports.
Our exploratory case study can only give ﬁrst insights into the ﬁeld of automated simpliﬁcation of
radiology reports with ChatGPT, especially due to the limited number of participants and radiology
report cases. Given the great potential of LLMs for simplifying radiology reports, there is a demand for
future research to validate the ﬁndings of our case study and to further explore the many possibilities
of this new technology in the medical domain. This requires quantitative studies on the quality
of simpliﬁed radiology reports generated with ChatGPT and similar LLMs. Also, the opinion of
patients regarding the accessibility of those simpliﬁed reports and their overall added value within
the treatment process should be investigated. We propose to include the automatic generation of
13simpliﬁed radiology reports in the clinical process based on a domain-adapted model. These should
be approved by experts and issued to patients alongside their original report. Overall, we see great
potential in using LLMs like ChatGPT to improve patient-centered care in radiology and other
medical domains.

An MRI is a special kind of picture that shows more detail inside your body. It can be taken
in different ways to get different types of pictures.
The medial compartment is the inside part of your leg. There is some damage to the cartilage,
which is a hard, smooth material that helps your joints move easily. There is also some
swelling and bruising on the inside of your knee. The meniscus, which is a c-shaped piece
of cartilage in your knee, is not damaged. However, there is some damage to the ligaments,
which are strong bands of tissue that help hold your bones together. There is also a small tear
in a muscle called the semimembranosus muscle.
The lateral compartment is the outside part of your leg. There is a lot of swelling in the bone
in the top part of your shin bone. There is no damage to the cartilage in this area. There is a
tear in the meniscus, which is a c-shaped piece of cartilage in your knee, on the outside of
your knee. There may also be some damage to the ligaments and muscles around your knee.
The patellofemoral joint is the joint between your knee cap (patella) and your thigh bone
(femur). There is some wear and tear on the tendons that attach your thigh muscles to your
knee cap and shin bone. Your knee cap is in the right position. There is some thinning of a
ligament called the M PFL.
The intercondylar joint is the joint between the two rounded parts (condyles) on the top of
your shin bone. The anterior cruciate ligament, which helps keep your shin bone in place, is
most likely completely torn. The posterior cruciate ligament, which is on the back of your
shin bone, is not damaged.
In conclusion, you have a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament, a higher grade tear
of the medial ligament, a tear in the meniscus, and a muscle ﬁber tear in the semimembranosus
muscle. There is also some swelling in the bone on the outside of your shin and some wear
and tear on the tendons around your knee cap. There is only minor damage to the cartilage on
the inside of your thigh bone.

Radiography is a way to take pictures of the inside of your body using special machines.
The doctor used a special kind of MRI machine to take many pictures of your leg from
different angles. They also used some extra techniques to make the pictures clearer.
In the middle part of your leg, there is a little bit of damage to the cartilage (a tough, rubbery
substance that helps your joints move smoothly) at the top of your shin bone. There is also
some swelling and bruising around the joint at the top of your shin bone. The cartilage in the
middle of your knee is not damaged. The meniscus (a cushion in your knee) is not damaged
either. However, some of the ligaments (tough, ﬁbrous bands of tissue that hold your joints
together) on the inside of your knee are slightly torn or frayed. There is also a small tear in a
muscle called the semimembranosus muscle.
On the outside of your leg, there is a lot of swelling in the bone around the joint at the top
of your shin bone. The cartilage in this area is not damaged. There is a tear in the meniscus
(a cushion in your knee) on the outside of your knee. It is possible that some other tissues
around the meniscus are also damaged. The ligament on the outside of your knee (called
the lateral collateral ligament) is not torn. However, there may be a tear in another ligament
called the anterolateral ligament. The muscle called the popliteus is not damaged.
In the front of your knee, the tendons (tough, ﬁbrous cords that connect muscles to bones)
that help straighten your leg are a little bit sore. The patella (your kneecap) is in the right
place. There is some thinning of a ligament called the M PFL.
In the back of your knee, the ligament that helps keep your shin bone in place (called the
anterior cruciate ligament) is most likely completely torn. The ligament that helps keep your
thigh bone in place (called the posterior cruciate ligament) is not damaged.
Overall, it looks like you have a complete tear in the anterior cruciate ligament and higher
grade tears in the medial ligaments in your knee. There is also a tear in the meniscus on the

or change the way the MRI machine takes pictures to get a better look at certain areas. They
might also use special techniques to help them see certain tissues more clearly.
The medical report is talking about a person’s knee. The knee has two compartments, the
medial compartment (the inner part) and the lateral compartment (the outer part).
In the medial compartment, there is some minor damage to the cartilage (a smooth, rubbery
material that covers the bones and helps them move smoothly against each other). There is
also some swelling and minor damage to the bone in this area. The meniscus (a c-shaped
piece of cartilage that acts like a shock absorber) is okay, but there is some damage to the
ligaments (tough bands of tissue that hold the bones together). There is also a small tear in
the semimembranosus muscle (a muscle in the leg).
In the lateral compartment, there is some swelling in the bone and no deﬁnite cartilage
damage. There is also a tear in the meniscus and possible damage to other tissues. The lateral
collateral ligament (another ligament in the knee) is okay. There is a possibility of damage to
the anterolateral ligament (another ligament in the knee), and the popliteus muscle (another
muscle in the leg) is okay.
In the patellofemoral joint (the joint between the patella, or kneecap, and the femur, or thigh
bone) and the quadriceps tendon (a tendon that connects the quadriceps muscle to the patella),
there is some minor wear andtear. The patella (kneecap) is in the correct position. The medial
patellofemoral ligament (a ligament in the knee) is thinned out.
In the intercondylar area ( thearea between thetwobones thatmake upthelower partof the
leg), the anterior cruciate ligament (a ligament in the knee) is most likely completely ruptured
(broken). The posterior cruciate ligament (another ligament in the knee) is okay.
The conclusion of the medical report is that the person has a complete rupture of the anterior
cruciate ligament, higher grade rupture of the medial ligament (mostly the superﬁcial portions),
a small fracture in the lateral tibial plateau without a step formation, a tear in the outer
meniscus posterior horn, and a muscle ﬁber tear of the semimembranosus muscle. There is
also minimal cartilage damage to the medial femoral condyle.

Okay, let’s break this down into simpler language.
Radiography is a type of medical test that uses special machines to take pictures of the inside
of your body. This can help doctors understand what might be wrong and how to help you.
An MRI is another type of medical test that also takes pictures of the inside of your body. It
uses magnets and radio waves instead of x-rays to get these pictures. Sometimes, doctors
need to do a special type of MRI where they take even more detailed pictures from different
angles, or they use extra techniques to get a clearer image.
Your knee has different parts, or compartments, that can be injured. The medial compartment
is the inside part of your knee, and the lateral compartment is the outside part.
In the medial compartment, there is some minor damage to the cartilage on the top of your
thigh bone. Cartilage is a tough, slippery material that helps your bones move smoothly
against each other. There is also some swelling and a little bit of injury to the cartilage on the
inside part of your knee. The meniscus, which is a C-shaped piece of cartilage in your knee,
is not damaged. However, there is some damage to the ligaments, which are strong bands of
tissue that hold your bones together and help your knee move. There is also a small tear in
one of the muscles in your thigh.
In the lateral compartment, there is a lot of swelling and injury inthebone insideyour lower
legbone. There is no damage to the cartilage in this area. There is a tear in the meniscus,
which is the C-shaped piece of cartilage in your knee, on the outside part of your knee. There
might also be some damage to other tissues in this area. The ligament on the outside of your
knee is not damaged. There is also no damage tothemuscleintheback ofyour knee.
In the patellofemoral joint, which is the joint where your kneecap (patella) and thigh bone
(femur) meet, there is some minor damage to the tendons, which are strong cords of tissue
that attach muscles to bones. The kneecap is in the right place. There is also some thinning
of the ligament that helps hold the kneecap in place.
In the intercondylar area, which is the area between the two bumpy parts (condyles) at the
topofyour thigh bone, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is completely torn. The ACL is
a very important ligament that helps keep your knee stable. The posterior cruciate ligament
(PCL), which is another important ligament in your knee, is not damaged.
Overall, this report is saying that you have a complete tear of the ACL and some other injuries
to the ligaments, bones, and cartilage in your knee. You also have a small tear in a muscle in
your thigh and some minor damage to the tendons around your kneecap. There is minimal
damage to the cartilage on the inside part of your knee.

Thelateralcompartment isthepartofyour body that’s ontheoutside, farther from the center.
There’s some swelling in the bone tissue on the outside of your lower leg bone, but no damage
to the cartilage. There’s also a tear in the meniscus on the outside of your knee, and possibly
some damage to nearby tissues. The ligament on the outside of your knee is okay, but there
might be a tear in the ligament on the front of your thigh. The muscle on the back of your
calf is okay.
The patellofemoral joint is the joint where your kneecap (patella) and your thigh bone (femur)
meet. There’s some minor damage to the tendons (tissues that connect muscles to bones) on
the front of your thigh and your kneecap, but the kneecap is in the right place. The ligament
on the inside of your knee is a little thin.
The intercondylar joint is the joint between the two parts of your thigh bone (femur). The
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is probably completely torn. The posterior cruciate ligament
(PCL) is okay.
So, the main problems are: a complete tear of the ACL, a higher grade tear of the medial
ligament, a tear in the meniscus on the outside of the knee, a small tear in the muscle on the
back of the thigh, and some minor damage to the cartilage on the inside of the leg bone.

The report also mentions the person’s liver, which is a big organ in the belly that helps with
digestion and getting rid of waste. It says that the liver looks normal and there are no cancer
spots on it. The report also mentions the person’s gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys,
which are all organs in the belly that help with different functions in the body. It says that
these organs look normal. The report also mentions some lymph nodes, which are small
bumps that help ﬁght infections. It says that some lymph nodes in the person’s belly have
been removed because they had cancer, but there is no evidence that the cancer has come
back. The report also mentions the person’s bones and says that there are no unusual spots on
them and no broken bones.
Overall, the report says that the person has cancer that started in their colon (a part of the
digestive system) and has spread to other parts of their body. The report says that the treatment
the person is getting is working and there isnoevidence ofthecancerspread ing to other parts
of the body.
62A.3.14 Simpliﬁed Report Sample #14
This medical report is talking about some pictures that were taken of the inside of a person’s
body. The pictures show how the person’s body is doing and how it has changed since the
last time they got pictures taken.
The pictures show that the person’s heart is normal and there is no extra ﬂuid around it. The
person’s thyroid gland is bigger than usual, but there is no extra ﬂuid in their chest and they
do not have an infection in their lungs. The person has some hard lumps on the inside of their
chest that have not changed. They also have some spots on their lungs that were caused by
cancer. These spots have gotten smaller and have some holes in them, which is a good sign
that the person is getting better.
The pictures also show that the person’s liver looks normal and there are no cancer spots
on it. The person’s gallbladder has a small stone, but it is not causing any problems. The
person’s other organs, like the spleen and pancreas, look normal. The person’s kidneys and
urinary system are also normal and there is no extra ﬂuid in the person’s belly. The person
had surgery to remove some cancer spots in their intestine and there are no new cancer spots
there. However, there are some hard lumps on the person’s back that doctors will keep an eye
on.
Finally, the pictures do not show any new bones with cancer or any broken bones. Overall,
the person’s body is showing a good response to treatment and the cancer is getting better in
some areas.
63A.3.15 Simpliﬁed Report Sample #15
This medical report is about a person who has cancer that has spread from their colon to
other parts of their body. The doctors used special pictures called CT scans to see inside
the person’s body. They looked at the person’s chest and saw that their heart is normal and
not causing any problems. They also saw some changes in the cancer in the person’s lungs
that suggest the treatment the person is receiving is working. The doctors also looked at the
person’s abdomen and saw that the cancer has not spread to the liver or other organs there.
They saw some changes in the lymph nodes in the person’s belly that may need to be watched
closely. Finally, the doctors looked at the person’s bones and did not see any signs of cancer
or broken bones. Overall, it looks like the treatment the person is receiving is helping to slow
down the cancer.

Experience
How many years of experience do you have as a radiologist (starting from yourﬁrst year of residency)?
What this questionnaire is about
Based on this questionnaire we will assess the quality of radiological reports that have been simpliﬁed by
the machine learning language model ChatGPT.
You will be presented 3 pairs of radiological reports. Each pair consists of (a) an original radiological report
and (b) a respective simpliﬁed version, created with ChatGPT.
We kindly ask you to read all reports carefully and answer the questions of this questionnaire.
How to answer this questionnaire
The questions can be found after each pair of reports ((a) original radiological report + (b) simpliﬁed
report).
Give your answers to the questions by ticking a number on the Likert scale and by writing your answer in
the space provided.
If you want to correct your answer, cross out your wrong answer clearly. On the Likert scale, also tick a new
number.
