OBJECTIVES: To study sensor monitoring (use of a sen-
sor network placed in the home environment to observeindividuals’ daily functioning (activities of daily living andinstrumental activities of daily living)) as a method to mea-
sure and support daily functioning for older people living
independently at home.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
SETTING: Participants’ homes.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals aged
65 and older.
MEASUREMENTS: A systematic search in PubMed,
Embase, PsycINFO, INSPEC, and The Cochrane Library
was performed for articles published between 2000 and
October 2012. All study designs, studies that described theuse of wireless sensor monitoring to measure or support
daily functioning for independently living older people,
studies that included community-dwelling individuals aged65 and older, and studies that focused on daily functioning
as a primary outcome measure were included.
RESULTS: Seventeen articles met the inclusion criteria.
Nine studies used sensor monitoring solely as a method for
measuring daily functioning and detecting changes in daily
functioning. These studies focused on the technical investi-gation of the sensor monitoring method used. The other
studies investigated clinical applications in daily practice.
The sensor data could enable healthcare professionalsto detect alert conditions and periods of decline and could
enable earlier intervention, although limited evidence of theeffect of interventions was found in these studies because
of a lack of high methodological quality.
CONCLUSION: Studies on the effectiveness of sensor
monitoring to support people in daily functioning remain
scarce. A road map for further development is proposed.

functional status
The maintenance of daily functioning is important for
allowing older people to live independently at home.
Daily functioning can be divided into activities of daily living(ADLs) (e.g., bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, conti-
nence, transferring, walking, eating) and instrumental activi-
ties of daily living (IADLs) (e.g., using the telephone,traveling, shopping, preparing meals, doing housework,
managing medications, handling money).
1Many older peo-
ple have two or more chronic diseases,2and they might expe-
rience increasing functional limitations that affect their
ability to perform ADLs and IADLs.3,4The way older people
perform ADLs and IADLs provides a measurement of theirfunctional status and ability to live independently at home.
5
Several methods are used to measure or evaluate
ADLs and IADLs. These are often limited to measuring
daily functioning using self-report such as with the modi-ﬁed Katz ADL scale
1or a more-objective measurement
method (e.g., the Assessment of Motor and Process
Skills).6Generally, these assessments are conducted as a
small series of measurements at a few time points. More
recently, new technologies, such as sensor monitoring,
have been developed to measure the daily functioning ofolder people continuously.From the*Research Group of Participation and the Environment,

Sensor monitoring is based on sensor network technol-
ogies and is used to monitor a person’s behavior and envi-
ronmental changes.7Sensor monitors can be wearable and
wireless. Wearable sensors, attached to a person or his orher clothes, are often used to measure such vital signs as
blood pressure and heart rate;
8to measure human physical
movement, such as walking, sitting transitions, and physi-cal exercises; and to monitor rehabilitation progress.
9
Wireless sensor networks, which consist of a combination
of simple sensors installed in ﬁxed locations are placed in
the home and register in-home movement. The sensor dataare processed in a computer that infers the daily function-
ing that participants perform in their homes.
7
The use of wireless sensor monitoring enables the mea-
surement of daily functioning and facilitates the early detec-
tion of changes in functional status by observing a certain
daily activity pattern.10A daily activity pattern gives
detailed information about which ADLs and IADLs are per-formed during a regular day and the sequences and varia-
tions of these activities.
11The sensor data are usually
analyzed using data mining and machine-learning techniquesto build activity models and further enable the measure daily
functioning and daily activity patterns.
7With data mining
from wireless sensor data, it is possible to determine mostADLs (e.g., bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, walking
and eating) and some IADLs (e.g., using the telephone,
preparing meals, managing medications, doing housework)performed in the home. It is not possible to measure handling
money, shopping, and traveling. Speciﬁc algorithms are
available to detect ADLs and IADLs and to detect uncom-mon patterns and therefore might enable early intervention.
Although several studies have examined the applica-
tion and evaluation of sensor monitoring, most have
focused on the use of wearable sensors and the technicalinvestigation of sensor monitoring or are conducted in lab-
oratory settings.
12No systematic review was found in
the literature focusing on the application and effectivenessof wireless sensor monitoring for older persons living
independently at home.
The aim of this systematic review was therefore to
study the application and effectiveness of sensor monitor-ing to measure and eventually support daily functioning in
older people living independently at home.
METHODS
Data Sources and Study Selection
In collaboration with a clinical librarian (JD), a systematic
search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO,
INSPEC, and The Cochrane Library for articles publishedin English between 2000 and 2012. The searches wereconducted on October 18, 2011, and updated on January
9, 2012, and October 25, 2012. A customized search strat-
egy was conducted for each database (Appendix S1).A manual search of references in the selected articles was
also conducted to identify additional studies.
Sensor Monitoring Method
Figure 1 depicts the application process involved in usingsensor monitoring to measure and support ADLs.
13Theactivity behavior of an ADL or IADL performed by an
elderly person (Figure 1A) is monitored using a wirelesssensor system installed in the home (Figure 1B). The sen-
sor network consists of simple binary sensors. Such sensors
may be passive infrared motion sensors (to detect motionin a speciﬁc area), magnetic contact sensors on doors andcabinets (to measure whether doors are opened or closed),
and a ﬂush sensor in the toilet (to measure the toilet being
ﬂushed).
13An intelligent machine (Figure 1C), which looks
for ADL, IADL, and daily activity patterns in the data
(e.g., the sensor system could recognize toileting or bathing
but also more-complex IADLs such as preparing breakfastand other kitchen activities), analyzes these sensor data.
A sequence of binary sensor data indicates the activity
with the help of an ADL recognition algorithm.
The results of these analyses can automatically trigger
an alarm (Figure 1D), for example, when no motion is
detected for a long period of time or if an older person is
in bed for several days. The automatic generation of areport within a predeﬁned period based on the sensor data
is also possible (Figure 1E).
The reports and the alarms can be given to healthcare
professionals (Figure 1F), who can use them to make
better-informed decisions or to design interventions to
support the older person.
Study Selection
Two reviewers (MP and SP) ﬁrst independently screenedtitles and abstracts for inclusion and then read the full textof the eligible articles found during this ﬁrst selection.Differences between the two reviewers were resolved by
consulting a third independent reviewer (BB).
Empirical studies that described the use of wireless
sensor monitoring to measure daily functioning or to sup-
port older people with daily functioning in which study
subjects included community-dwelling older persons aged65 and older and daily functioning was a primary outcome
measured in the study were included.
Studies that focused solely on people diagnosed with
severe dementia or severe cognitive problems (Mini-MentalState Examination score <16) were excluded.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
For each included study, data on study characteristics were
extracted. Data were collected on type of sensor monitor-ing technology, number and type of sensors used, duration
of sensor monitoring, and aim of sensor monitoring. Data
were collected on participant demographic and clinical(main diagnoses, comorbidities, functional, and cognitivestatus) characteristics.
The same reviewers also independently assessed the
quality of the included studies. Because of the variety ofnonrandomized study designs included in this systematic
review, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
14was used to evaluate
the risk of bias in the case controlled studies, the pre –post
design study, and the mixed method study (Appendix S2).
Disagreements were discussed; in cases of disagreement, a
third reviewer was enlisted.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Given the heterogeneity of the reporting and designs of theincluded studies, a descriptive approach was used to sum-marize study characteristics and outcomes. The includedstudies were categorized into those that aimed to measure
daily functioning and those that aimed to support people
in their daily functioning. No statistical pooling wasconducted.RESULTS
Search Result
The literature search identiﬁed 6,795 articles (Figure 2,
Appendix S1). After the titles and abstracts were screened,
6,717 studies were excluded because they did not pertain tosensor monitoring, were discussion papers or editorials onthe topic of sensor monitoring, or did not meet the inclusion
criteria. In the next phase, 78 full-text articles were
screened, and 61 of those were excluded, 18 for not meetingthe inclusion criteria on design (review or theoretical study),
15 for not meeting the criteria for the intervention (only
wearable sensors), eight for not meeting the inclusion crite-ria for participant age, and 16 for not meeting the criteria
for the outcome measure (ADL and IADL function was not
the primary outcome). Four were duplicates. Seventeenstudies were included in this systematic review.
Quality of the Included Studies
Appendix S2 shows the results of the quality assessment of
the three case –control studies and the pre –post design and
mixed method studies included in this review. Three studieswere considered low quality, and two were considered mod-
erate quality. The studies had a small sample size or unclear
inclusion and exclusion criteria or lacked follow-up.

Characteristics of the Studies
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies.
There were three case –control studies,15–17one mixed-
methods study,18one longitudinal pilot study,19one
single-group pre –post design study,20three multiple-case
studies,8,21,22seven case studies,23–29and one experi-
ment.30
The number of people included in the studies varied
from one to 52. In seven studies, the mean age of the olderparticipants was not speciﬁed. The weighted mean age of
the participants in the remaining eight studies was 82.6.
Seven of the studies were conducted in senior houses
or assisted living settings,
8,16,17,21,22,24,25and four studies
were conducted in smart home apartments.23,26,28,30Six
studies were conducted in an independent living setting inthe community.
15,18 –20,27,29
Ten studies did not report or specify clinical data of
the participants. Four studies included participants withoutany reported diseases (healthy volunteers). Of the studiesthat investigated speciﬁc subgroups of older persons, most
of the included participants had one or more chronic dis-
eases. Only two studies provided a formal description ofthe functional or cognitive status of the included partici-
pants.
All of the studies focused on ADLs and IADLs as an
outcome measure. Among the speciﬁc focuses were mea-
surement of ADLs and IADLs,

Characteristics of the Sensor Monitoring Method
The summary characteristics of the sensor monitoring
method are described in Table 2. Studies were divided
according to whether they aimed solely to measure dailyfunctioning
15,21,23 –26,28 –30and whether they aimed to sup-
port people in performing their ADLs and IADLs.8,16 –20,22,27
The studies that aimed solely to measure daily func-
tioning focused mainly on technological development or
investigating the artiﬁcial intelligence analysis method
behind the sensor monitoring system. The studies that alsofocused on supporting people in daily functioning includeda more-detailed focus on the clinical relevance of sensor
monitoring methods. All studies with a technological view-
point mentioned some future possibilities for the use ofsensor monitoring in daily clinical practice.
Three of the identiﬁed studies combined the use of a
wireless sensor network with wearable sensors
16,20,30and
video.8,22,28The most common wireless sensors used were
passive infrared motion sensors, magnetic contact switches,
and some other binary sensors, such as pressure, ﬂoat, andtemperature sensors.
Effectiveness of Sensor Monitoring
All of the included studies reported positive results for the
use of the sensor monitoring method. These studies investi-
gated the models used to analyze the sensor data or tomeasure daily functioning or determine ADL patterns forpeople living alone and to identify changes in their typical
ADL patterns. The results are presented in Table 2. Most
of the studies reported potential advantages of the use of
sensor monitoring to improve healthcare outcomes,although the effects were not studied in randomized clini-
cal trials, and the studies lacked sufﬁcient power to detect
changes or effects. Two of the three included case –control
studies did report better effects of the sensor monitoringmethod, such as the early detection of clinically relevant
changes, than with the regular care provided to the control
group.
15,17One case –control study reported lower esti-
mated costs of care over a 3-month monitoring period,
fewer hospital days, and a positive effect of the method on
professional caregiver efﬁciency,17but all of these studies
had small sample sizes.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview
of the use of sensor monitoring to measure and support
the daily functioning of older people living independentlyat home.
It found that half of the included studies used sensor
monitoring solely as a method to measure ADLs andIADLs and to detect changes in daily functioning for a per-son living independently. These studies tended to focus on
the technical aspects of the sensor monitoring method
used. The other half of the studies investigated how theuse of sensor monitoring could support people in their
daily functioning and allow them to live independently at
home, but most of the studies were small in scale, and evi-dence of the methods’ effectiveness was lacking. The
included studies demonstrate an important gap between
the technological development of sensor monitoring, whichis already signiﬁcant, and its application and effectivenessin daily practice. The included studies illustrated that
healthcare professionals could take advantage of sensor
monitoring to detect early periods of physical decline morequickly than when traditional means of measuring func-
tional status are used. This might enable professionals
to provide early interventions to prevent the declinecaused by falls or immobility, thereby inﬂuencing clinical
outcomes.
A road map is proposed to further develop and
improve the use of sensor monitoring to measure and sup-
port daily functioning in independently living older people
and to collect evidence about the applicability and effec-tiveness of sensor monitoring for clinical practice. Thisroad map consists of the following steps.
●Determining the target population that can beneﬁt from
sensor monitoring . Because of the strong focus on the
technical considerations of sensor monitoring, a signiﬁ-cant number of studies did not specify or report impor-
tant demographic and clinical data of the participants.
Therefore, it was difﬁcult to study which older peoplemight beneﬁt from sensor monitoring to support theirdaily functioning. Although this review showed that
older people with one or more chronic diseases and
those with mild cognitive problems could be a potentialtarget group for sensor monitoring, more-speciﬁc inves-
tigation into the characteristics of the target population2222 POL ET AL. DECEMBER 2013–VOL. 61, NO. 12 JAGS

is needed to be of value in clinical practice. Future
research should include demographic and clinical data.
●Investigation of the use of sensor monitoring in com-
munity-dwelling older persons. Early observation of a
decline in daily functioning enables healthcare profes-
sionals to provide early interventions or support clinical
decisions. Potential goals for individuals can includeliving longer independently at home, preventing read-mission to the hospital, and minimizing emergency
department visits
8,22It has been suggested that sensor
monitoring could also be useful to measure and supportthe recovery of older people after hospital admission,
8
although evidence pertaining to the effectiveness ofthese possible applications is still lacking. Furtherresearch is needed to investigate and validate these
applications and their role in inﬂuencing clinical
outcomes.
●Guidelines for healthcare professionals regarding the
use of sensor monitoring. Although all of the included
studies illustrated promising possibilities for the use of
the sensor data in clinical practice, none of themfocused on guidelines for healthcare professionals to
use sensor data with their patients. In a few studies, the
sensor data were connected over a secure web-basedinterface for use by healthcare professionals. One study
developed a visualization application (density map) for
healthcare providers
24to identify daily activity patterns
and changes in patterns. This visualization application
was used in two studies by retrospectively viewing and
analyzing the data for the periods before and afterhealth events, such as hospitalizations, falls, and emer-gency department visits.
8,22The focus for future
research should be developing and testing visualizations
of sensor data for healthcare professionals for support-ing people in daily functioning and guidelines for
healthcare professionals regarding the use of the sensor
data in caring for their patients and advising caregivers.
●Involvement of the participants, caregivers, and health-
care professionals in the further development and
implementation of sensor monitoring. Because sensor
monitoring is a promising method for supporting olderpeople in their everyday life, research must address the
needs and expectations of the endusers and healthcare
professionals.
32,31Study participants indicated that they
felt safer having the sensors in their homes and could
use the sensor data as feedback, enabling themselves to
change their behaviors in an effort to function indepen-dently at home for as long as possible.
22Therefore,
future research should involve individuals and health-
care professionals to customize the use of sensors to theparticipants’ speciﬁc needs.
●Conducting large-scale clinical trials. The success of
sensor monitoring depends on evidence of the method’seffectiveness in achieving its goals. If studies are estab-lished, they should be of a higher methodological qual-
ity than existing studies and should express clear
inclusion and exclusion criteria, proper research design,and a power calculation to include a sufﬁcient number
of people.
●Study the cost effectiveness of sensor monitoring. It has
been demonstrated that sensor monitoring provides
effective care coordination tools that have a positiveTable 2. Characteristics of Measurement and Support Studies

effect on professional caregivers’ efﬁciency; reduce care-
giver workloads; and result in signiﬁcantly fewer hospi-
tal days, hospital visits, and emergency department
visits.17,24Possible improved outcomes for healthcare
professionals include a positive effect on healthcare
professionals’ efﬁciency and workload,17although these
results were found in just one study with a small sam-ple size, and the results could not be compared withthose of other studies. Future research should investi-
gate the cost effectiveness of sensor monitoring.
CONCLUSION
The use of sensor monitoring could provide promising
opportunities in clinical practice by measuring and support-
ing daily functioning in older persons living independently,
although clear evidence is still lacking. This systematicreview also showed that the research has focused largely onthe technical aspects of sensor monitoring and less on its
application in everyday life and clinical practice. Future
research should focus on facilitating the use of sensor mon-itoring in everyday life and clinical practice. To encourage
this, a roadmap for future research was proposed that
includes the participation of the older people themselves.
