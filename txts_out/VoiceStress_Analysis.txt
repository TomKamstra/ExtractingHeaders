Abstract. The nonverbal content of speech carries information about
the physiological and psychological condition of the speaker. Psycholog-
ical stress is a pathological element of this condition, of which the cause
is accepted to be “workload”. Objective, quantiﬁable correlates of stress
are searched for by means of measuring the acoustic modiﬁcations of the
voice brought about by workload. Diﬀerent voice features from the speech
signal to be inﬂuenced by stress are: loudness, fundamental frequency,
jitter, zero-crossing rate, speech rate and high-energy frequency ratio. To
examine the eﬀect of workload on speech production an experiment was
designed. 108 native speakers of Dutch were recruited to participate in
a stress test (Stroop test). The experiment and the analysis of the test
results will be reported in this paper.
1 Introduction
Although speech is a vocal activity of which much is verbal, there are a number
of human vocalizations that are essentially non-linguistic. Nonverbal aspects of
speech are intonation, voice quality, prosody, rhythm and pausing. These phe-
nomena stand for a non-verbal signaling system, which intertwines with the
verbal or linguistic system. The non-verbal content of the voice carries, among
other things, information about the physiological and psychological state of the
speaker. Human beings are able to identify diﬀerent emotional states, because
these are characterized by clearly perceptible (non-verbal) behavior. Part of this
non-verbal communication takes place via other modalities like body movements
and facial expressions [9]. The question that remains is how much of this infor-
mation can be recovered from non-verbal vocalizations only.
One of the most interesting research areas concerning non-verbal communi-
cation in relation to a person’s psychological state is the search for objective,
quantiﬁable correlates of stress. In the past this search focused primarily on
physiological measures, but over the last years a broader range of behaviors has
been examined, especially non-verbal behavior. The advantage being that stress
indexes from non-verbal vocalizations can be obtained non-intrusively. From a
practical point of view this is critical in a situation in which co-operation for
physiological measurement is precluded, for example in the case of negotiatingwith terrorists. However, even when co-operation is possible, the presence of
monitoring devices needed for physiological measurement can be stressful and
anxiety arousing or simply not practical.
Psychological stress is a pathological element of the physiological and psycho-
logical condition of the speaker, of which the cause is accepted to be “workload”
[14]. Objective, quantiﬁable correlates of stress are searched for by means of
measuring the acoustic modiﬁcations of the voice brought about by workload.
These changes in the acoustic speech signal due to stress are mainly caused
by the physiological changes that accompany the stress-reaction. These changes
also aﬀect the organs of speech, such as the respiration and muscle tension (vocal
cords) and therefore the speech signal. Hence, it should be possible to establish
whether a person is stressed just by analyzing his voice.
2 Related Work
Much work on stress analysis in real life situations concentrates on air-ground
communication in aviation and space ﬂight under dangerous conditions. In many
of these studies [8, 21] an increase of the fundamental frequency (F0) of the voice
in situations of increasing danger is reported. Williams and Stevens [21] also re-
ported an increase in F0 range and abrupt ﬂuctuations of F0 contour, with
increasing stress. In a Russian study [16] the voices of astronauts are examined
and changes in spectral energy distribution (spectral centroid moving to higher
frequency) are reported. Increase of the energy of high frequency components,
has also been reported by [11] in a study involving pilot communication. Scherer
et al. found depressive patients speak with higher F0 and a larger proportion of
high frequency components, just before the admission at a psychiatric hospital
[13]. Jones [7] found increases in fundamental frequency and statistically signif-
icant decreases of the vocal jitter in recordings obtained from pilots training in
a simulated AWACS environment.
In many laboratory studies, stress is brought about by showing unpleasant
or disgusting slides or ﬁlms, or by placing the subject in situations that pro-
duce unpleasant emotions, such as stage fright. The degree of stress perceived
will vary from person to person depending on the persons experience and arous-
ability. Apart from these individual diﬀerences, some studies show an increase
in intensity, increased fundamental frequency [17, 12], stronger concentration of
energy above 500 Hz [12] and an increase in speech rate [15].
More recently, many experiments were conducted in which cognitive or achieve-
ment tasks were used to induce stress on a subject [6, 2]. When persons were sub-
jected to a psychomotor task [5], the speaking fundamental frequency showed
an increase when the task became more diﬃcult. In addition, word duration
increased during the task, but decreased again when the task became more com-
plex. Brenner [3] also found an increase in average amplitude when subjects
where performing a tracking task.
Table 1 summarizes the parameters that have been shown to be indicators
of the vocal expression of emotion, emotional disturbance or stress.Table 1. Overview of major acoustic parameters [13]

3 Experimental Design
To study the correspondence between human stress levels and speech produc-
tion and to assess the relevance of the features listed in Table 1, an exploring
experiment has been conducted. 108 native speakers of Dutch were subjected
to several tasks that have been designed to place a cognitive workload on the
subject. Cognitive workload is deﬁned as the information-processing load placed
on the human operator while performing a particular task [14]. This information
processing load is considered to be correlated with the amount of attention that
must be directed to a task. It is assumed that cognitive workload increases with
the diﬃculty of the task. In the present investigation subjects performed three
tasks. In the ﬁrst test subjects had to play a computer game that gradually
became more diﬃcult. The second task required to simultaneously engage in
two attention-demanding activities. Finally, the participants were subjected to a
psychological stress test. During all tasks and during a controlled rest-condition
before the tasks, the subjects produced utterances. Acoustical analyses of all
utterances were made and compared with the control condition and with the
acoustical analyses of the other utterances produced during the same task.
The psychological stress test, an instance of the Stroop test, proved to be
the most demanding task for the subjects thus providing the clearest results.
Therefore we will concentrate on the results of this task for the remainder of the
paper.3.1 Stroop Test
The Stroop test is a well-known psychological test [18] that exploits the fact
that for experienced readers, the reading of a word has become an automatism.
In its native form this test consisted of three cards: on the ﬁrst card a great
number of little squares are drawn in the colors red, blue, green and yellow. On
the second card the words red, blue, green and yellow in black ink are placed on
the corresponding positions. On the third card, the conﬂict card, the same words
as on the second card are placed, but now using a non-corresponding ink-color.
It turns out that the time needed to name the colors on the conﬂict card is much
higher than the time taken for naming them on the ﬁrst card. Furthermore, the
subjects tend to make more mistakes reading the third card and show signs of
tension (movement, sudden laughs).
In the current experiment a variation on the Stroop-test was used, in which
a gradual increase of the level of diﬃculty is incorporated. The names of the
colors (printed in diﬀerent colored ink) were put on a computer screen one by
one. The diﬃculty of the task increased as the time between the appearances of
the colors was shortened every minute with half a second, thus decreasing from
two and a half seconds at the start to half a second in the ﬁnal minute.
3.2 Jitter
During the experiments fundamental frequency, variation of fundamental fre-
quency, jitter, energy, high frequency energy ratio, duration and the number
of zero crossings were monitored as candidate vocal stress correlates. Of those
features, jitter may require some explanation.
Jitter is the perturbation in the vibration of the vocal chords. This results
in a cycle-to-cycle variation of the fundamental frequency. [19] reported that
about 20 cycles are enough for jitter analysis. Formally the term perturbation
implies a deviation from steadiness or regularity [10]. Let aibe any cyclic pa-
rameter (amplitude, pitch period, etc.) in the ithcycle of the waveform. Then
the steady value of this parameter over a span of Ncycles can be estimated from
its arithmetic mean:
a=1
NN/summationdisplay
i=1ai (1)
And the zeroth-order perturbation function as the arithmetic diﬀerence:
p0
i=ai−a, i = 1, . . . , N (2)
Where the superscript gives the order of the perturbation function. Higher-order
perturbation functions can be obtained by alternately taking backward and for-
ward diﬀerences of lower order functions. We will consider the ﬁrst-order per-
turbation function:
p1
i=p0
i−p0
i−1=ai−ai−1, i = 1, . . . , N (3)The ﬁrst order perturbation function can be used to determine the fundamen-
tal frequency perturbation if in Equation 3 aiis taken to be the fundamental
frequency. The fundamental frequency is computed only for the voiced parts of
speech. The fundamental frequency perturbation is deﬁned as the average of the
absolute values of all these diﬀerences normalised to percentage:
jitter =100
(N−1)aN/summationdisplay
i=2|ai−ai−1| (4)
4 Experimental Results
In this section the results of statistical analysis of the acoustical data are de-
scribed. Table 2 reports the averages and standard deviations of the data col-
lected during the Stroop test. The conditional eﬀects in relation to the observed
eﬀects in the features will now be discussed from condition to condition. The ﬁrst
minute is considered to represent normal conditions and is used for comparison.

mental frequency and a decrease of the duration and jitter can be observed, as
can be expected. However, the high frequency energy shows a decrease, which is
even more surprising when regarding the increase in the fundamental frequency
and zero crossings. Fundamental frequency variation stays approximately the
same.
Stroop 3. The fundamental frequency shows a decrease compared to the previous
condition, but is still slightly higher than the ﬁrst minute. Duration, zero crossing
and jitter are stable at this point, but the high frequency energy ratio is still
low. Fundamental frequency variation shows an increase.
Stroop 4. A steep increase in fundamental frequency and F0 variation and zero
crossings is observed and still a stable jitter ratio, but high frequency is very low
here. Also an increase in the duration can be witnessed, which may be because
the color names diﬀer signiﬁcantly in the fourth minute of the test.
Stroop 5. A signiﬁcant decrease in jitter ratio is observed in the last and most
intense minute of the test. Fundamental frequency and F0 variation are still
signiﬁcantly higher than at the beginning of the test and duration and high
frequency energy are still oppositely signed from the expected diﬀerences.
In summary the jitter ratio and partially the fundamental frequency show
expected results and especially the high frequency energy shows the total op-
posite of what is presumed, showing an overall decrease where an increase is
expected. Fundamental frequency variation shows a consistent increase towards
the end of the test. However, before any conclusions are drawn the eﬀect of the
color names on the diﬀerent conditions will be examined.
In Table 3 the mean values are repeated but now they are split per color. Several
things can be noticed from these tables. The color yellow shows an overall de-
crease in duration even when other colors show an increase. In all cases the jitter
shows a decrease. In practically all cases the fundamental frequency shows an
increase, but diﬀerences in increase vary among the colors, which is less the case
with jitter. Blue is the only color, which shows an increase in high frequency
energy ratio. HF diﬀerences of the same colors are all closely together, which
may point to dependence of the high frequency ratio on the verbal content, for
example through intonational patterns. However, when looking separately at the
HF’s per color, there appears a reasonable consistent increase in HF over the
conditions toward the end.
It can be concluded that the high frequency energy is highly dependent on
the name of the color, and the jitter the least dependent. The duration is highly
variable, but does show some consistency for the word yellow .
5 Conclusions
In this work the inﬂuence of stress on the human voice has been investigated.
Stress is thought of as being caused by the workload a human is confrontedTable 3. Scores of Stroop conditions 2,3,4 and 5

with and involves a series of physiological and psychological changes. The phys-
iological changes will among others aﬀect speech production organs and thus
the voice. Whether or not this physiological reaction pattern is to some extent
person speciﬁc is still a point of discussion. It seems that the impact of a stressor
is determined by his experience and physique, but this only implies that some
persons can become more stressed than others.
Shifting towards the search for objective quantiﬁable vocal stress correlates, it
turns out that a number of non-verbal vocal characteristics are subject to change
when a person is speaking in a stressful situation. Among these are fundamental
frequencies, duration, intensity, jitter, high frequency energy and formant posi-
tions. The experiments discussed here have shown that the most important and
promising stress correlates are the fundamental frequency and the fundamental
frequency perturbation or jitter. The latter is especially useful as it is, unlike
other features such a the high frequency energy ratio, relatively insensitive to
prosodic patterns already present is speech, thus allowing assessment of stress
levels without knowledge of the words that are being spoken. As the ultimate
goal of our research is to develop a stress-o-meter based on non-intrusive tech-
niques such as speech recognition we are planning to assess how well the vocal
stress features correlate with physiological measurements [20].
