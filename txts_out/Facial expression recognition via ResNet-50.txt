Facial expression  recognition  
ResNet-50  a b s t r a c t 
As one of the most important  directions  in the ﬁeld of computer  vision, facial emotion  recognition  plays an 
important  role in people’s  daily work and life. Human emotion  recognition  based on facial expressions  is of 
great signiﬁcance  in the application  of intelligent  human-computer  interaction.  However,  in the current research  
on facial emotion  recognition,  there are some problems  such as poor generalization  ability of network  model 
and low robustness  of recognition  system. In this content,  we propose a method of feature extraction  using the 
deep residual  network  ResNet-50,  which combines  convolutional  neural network  for facial emotion  recognition.  
Through  the experimental  simulation  of the speciﬁed  data set, it can be proved that this model is superior  to the 
current mainstream  facial emotion  recognition  models in the performance  of facial emotion  detection.  
1. Introduction  
With the rapid development  of artiﬁcial  intelligence,  people pay 
more and more attention  to the emotional  intelligence  ( Gonzalez-  
Yubero,  Lazaro-Visa  & Palomera,  2021 ) of machines,  we are more eager 
to people’s  communication  with the computer  can be like the means 
of communication  between  people ( Hanaﬁ&  Daud, 2021 ). This can be 
achieved  only if computers  can understand  people’s  emotions,  and facial 
expression  recognition  is an eﬀective  way to achieve  it. Facial emotion  
recognition  refers to the separation  of speciﬁc  facial states from a given 
static image or dynamic  video sequence,  so as to determine  the psy- 
chological  emotions  of the object to be recognized.  On the other hand, 
facial emotion  is an important  non-verbal  expression  in daily communi-  
cation. By observing  the changes  of facial emotion  ( Furlong  et al., 2021 ; 
Graumann  et al., 2021 ; Staﬀet  al., 2021 ), we can better recognize  the 
emotional  changes  of the other party. Similarly,  in the ﬁeld of computer  
vision, facial emotion  recognition  is also an important  research  direc- 
tion. Accurate  recognition  of facial emotions  through  computer  vision 
recognition  system will be conducive  to the smooth  progress  of psy- 
chological  recognition,  human-computer  interaction,  assisted  driving,  
station security  and other work. 
Facial emotion  recognition  is to analyze  a given facial expression  
and use the analysis  results to classify  speciﬁc  emotions  ( Hajarolasvadi  
& Demirel,  Dec, 2020 ; Rajananda,  Zhu & Peters, 2020 ). Facial emo- 
tions can be divided  into seven categories:  happy, sad, fearful,  angry, 
surprised,  disgusted  and neutral.  The ﬁrst thing to do for facial ex- 
pression  recognition  is to preprocess  the collected  images,  then carry 
out feature extraction  and classiﬁcation  recognition.  With the emer-

the convolutional  neural network  to extract image features.  Ali, Hari- 
haran, Yaacob  and Adom, (2015) proposed  the use of support  vector 
machine  (SVM) method.  Evans ( Evans, 2017 ) presented  to use Haar 
wavelet  transform  (HWT) method.  Phillips  ( Phillips,  2018 ) presented  
a novel method  combining  stationary  wavelet  entropy  and Jaya algo- 
rithm. Through  the analysis  of the above literatures,  it can be found 
that the facial emotional  features  extracted  by the above methods  have 
the problem  that the original  emotional  information  is easy to be lost. In 
addition,  the generalization  and robustness  of these network  models are 
also poor and the accuracy  of facial expression  recognition  is not high. 
For the above problems,  we propose  an improved  facial emotion  
recognition  model. We use ResNet-50  as the network  infrastructure.  
Feature  is extracted  by convolutional  neural network,  BN and activa- 
tion function  ReLU are used to improve  the convergence  ability of the 
model. Through  the simulation  experiment  below, it can be veriﬁed  that 
the recognition  performance  of the proposed  facial emotion  recognition  
method  is better than the most advanced  method.

3. Methodology  
3.1. Convolution  
Convolution  ( Hasebe  & Ueda, 2021 ) is widely used in the ﬁeld of 
image processing,  such as ﬁltering,  edge detection,  image sharpening,  
etc. ( Belinschi,  Bercovici  & Liu, 2021 ; Tiwari,  Jul-Sep,  2021 ), all of 
which are realized  by diﬀerent  convolution  kernels.  In the convolutional  
neural network,  features  in the image can be extracted  by convolution  
operation  ( Sahani & Dash, Apr, 2021 ). The lower convolutional  layer 
can extract some features  such as edges, lines and angles of the image 
( Guttery,  2021 ; Satapathy,  2021 ; Wang, 2021a , 2021b ). The higher con- 
volutional  layer can learn more complex  features  from the lower convo- 
lutional  layer, so as to realize image classiﬁcation  and recognition.  As is 
shown in (1), convolution  is a mathematical  operator  that generates  a 
third function  by two functions  𝑓and 𝑔, and 𝑟 ( 𝑥 ) represents  the integral  
of the overlap  length of the product  of the overlapping  function  values 
of the function  𝑓and 𝑔by ﬂipping  and shifting.  
𝑟 ( 𝑥 ) = ∫∞
−∞𝑓 ( 𝜏) 𝑔 ( 𝑥 − 𝜏) 𝑑𝜏 (1) 
The physical  meaning  of convolution  is the weighted  superposition  
of one function  over another.  The output of the system is the result of 
the superposition  of multiple  inputs. In the image analysis,  𝑓( 𝑥 ) is the 
original  pixel point, 𝑔( 𝑥 ) is the action point. All the action points are 
combined  into the convolution  kernel. After all the action points on the 
convolution  kernel are applied  to the original  pixel points in turn, the 
output of the ﬁnal convolution  is obtained.  
3.1.1. Standard  convolution  
The element  of convolution  operation  in the convolutional  layer is 
called the convolution  kernel, and its parameters  need to be learned  
( Bister et al., 2021 ; Ganguly  et al., 2021 ). The size of the convolution  
kernel should be smaller  than the size of the input image. During the 
convolution  process,  each kernel is convolved  with the input image to 
calculate  a feature map ( Satapathy  & Wu, 2020 ; Wang, 2021a , 2021b ; 
Zhang, Nayak, Zhang & Wang, 2020 ). In other words, the convolution  
kernel will slide over the input image and computes  the dot product  
between  the input and the convolution  kernel at each spatial position.  
Then, the feature map of each kernel is superimposed  along the depth 
dimension  to obtain the output image of the convolutional  layer. In short, convolution  is the multiplication  and addition  of the corre- 
sponding  elements  between  the input matrix and the convolution  ker- 
nel. Finally,  the whole input matrix is traversed  and the result matrix 
is obtained.  Each kernel is smaller  in width and height when compared  
to the input, each neuron in the activation  map is associated  only to a 
small local area of the input image, which means size of each neuron’s  
receptive  ﬁeld is small, equals to size of kernel. From the perspective  
of template  matching,  the convolution  kernel deﬁnes a certain pattern.  
The convolution  operation  is to calculate  the degree of similarity  be- 
tween each location  and the pattern,  or the number  of components  of 
the pattern  at each location.  The more similar the current  location  is to 
the pattern,  the stronger  the response  will be. 
Here, the kernel convolves  the position  of each unit of the input 
image, and we end up with a convolved  image. In Fig. 2 , we use a kernel 
of 3 ×3 with a stride of 1.For each point, you can take this point and 
convolve  it with the 3 by 3 points around it. 
3.2. Pooling 
After obtaining  feature map through  convolutional  layer, the next 
step is to integrate  and classify  these features.  Theoretically,  all features  
extracted  by convolution  can be used as input to a classiﬁer,  such as the 
Softmax  classiﬁer  ( Ashiquzzaman  et al., 2020 ; Satapathy  & Zhu, 2020 ), 
but doing so has large amount  of calculation.  At this time, we will use 
pooling  layer to get the feature dimension  reduce.  We can approximate  
the pixel point around some pixel points, count the eigenvalues  of a cer- 
tain position  and its adjacent  positions  in the plane, and take the sum- 
marized  result as the value of this position  in the plane. Pooling  is a pro- 
cess of abstracting  information  ( Wang, 2020 ; Wu, 2020 ; Zhang, 2020 ). 
Pooling  layer is also called the down-sampling  layer, it aims to reduce 
the size of matrix generated  by a convolutional  layer. On the one hand, 
pooling  reduces  features  and parameters,  thus simplifying  the complex-  
ity of convolutional  network  calculation.  Pooling  also prevents  overﬁt-  
ting to a certain extent, making  optimization  more convenient.  On the 
other hand, some invariance  of features  is maintained,  such as rotation,  
translation  and contraction,  etc. Pooling  can increase  the invariance  of 
the network  against  translation,  which is very critical to the improve-  
ment of the network  generalization  ability. Pooling  makes the model 
pay more attention  to the existence  of certain features  rather than the 
speciﬁc  location  of the feature.  Another  use of pooling  is to increase  the 
receptive  ﬁeld, that is, the size of a pixel corresponding  to the original  
image, which improves  the capability  of the model. There are two main 
pooling  operations,  Average  Pooling  and Max Pooling.  
3.2.1. Average  pooling 
The error of feature extraction  mainly comes from two aspects:  The 
ﬁrst error is that the estimated  variance  increases  due to the limitation  of 
58 B. Li and D. Lima International  Journal of Cognitive Computing  in Engineering  2 (2021) 57–64

Fig. 3. Average  Pooling.  
neighborhood  size. The second error is that the convolution  layer param- 
eter error causes the deviation  of the estimated  mean value. In general,  
Average  Pooling  can reduce the ﬁrst error and retain more background  
information  of the image. Average  Pooling  emphasizes  the sublayer  sam- 
pling of the overall feature information,  which ensures  the integrity  of 
the transmitted  information  and reduces  the parameter  dimension.  In 
large models such as Dense Net, Average  Pooling  is often used to re- 
duce dimensions  and facilitate  information  transfer  to the next module  
to extract features.  
In a simple term, Average  Pooling  means taking the average  of a 
small range. Fig. 3 indicates  an instance  of average  pooling  utilizing  a 
kernel of 3 ×3 with a stride of 3. After pooling,  the average  value in the 
3 ×3 kernel will be calculated  and reserved  in a rectiﬁed  feature map. 
In this way, the 6 ×6 input is compressed  to 2 ×2. 
3.2.2. Max pooling 
Generally  speaking,  Max Pooling  is more eﬃcient  and is a common  
method  in image processing.  It’s kind of like making  feature choices.  
Max Pooling  selects features  with good classiﬁcation  and recognition  
performance  and has nonlinear  characteristics.  In addition,  Max Pooling  
can handle the second error mentioned  above and retain texture features  
well. For instance,  if the feature we need to ﬁnd is a cat, then as long as 
there is a cat in one area of the image, it means that there is a cat in the 
whole image. Therefore,  we should take the maximum  matching  degree 
between  all areas in the image and the features  of the cat, that is, max 
pooling  should be utilized.  Fig. 4. Max Pooling.  
In a simple term, Max Pooling  means taking the maximum  of a small 
range. Fig. 4 indicates  an instance  of max pooling  utilizing  a kernel of 
3 ×3 with a stride of 3. After pooling,  the maximum  value in the 3 ×3 
kernel will be left in a rectiﬁed  feature map. Eventually,  the 6 ×6 input 
image is shrunk to 2 ×2. 
3.3. Batch normalization  
Batch Normalization  is a training  optimization  method.  In CNN, 
batch is the number  of images that are trained  on the network.  The 
reason why input data need normalization  is that the learning  pro- 
cess of neural network  is essentially  to learn data distribution  ( Choi & 
Jung, Mar, 2020 ; Garbin,  Zhu & Marques,  2020 ). Once the distribution  
of training  data is diﬀerent  from that of test data, the generalization  
ability of the network  is greatly reduced.  On the other hand, once the 
distribution  of each batch of training  data is diﬀerent  (batch gradient  
descent),  the network  has to learn to adapt to diﬀerent  distributions  in 
each iteration  ( Govindaraj,  2019 ; Muhammad,  2019 ; Sangaiah,  2020 ). 
This will greatly reduce the training  speed of the network,  which is 
the reason why we need to do a normalized  pretreatment  of the data. 
The training  of deep network  is a complicated  process  ( Nencka  et al., 
2021 ; Nishida  et al., 2020 ). As long as the ﬁrst few layers of the net- 
work change slightly,  the changes  in the next few layers will gradually  
increase.  Therefore,  if the distribution  of training  data keeps changing  
59 B. Li and D. Lima International  Journal of Cognitive Computing  in Engineering  2 (2021) 57–64 
Fig. 5. Batch Normalization  Process.  
during the training  process,  the training  speed of the network  will be 
aﬀected.  
SGD is simple and eﬃcient  for training  deep network,  but it 
has a problem  that it requires  us to select parameters  artiﬁcially  
( Benbahria,  Sebari, Hajji & Smiej, 2021 ; Polat & Gungen,  2021 ), such as 
learning  rate, parameter  initialization,  weight attenuation  coeﬃcient,  
Drop out ratio, etc. The selection  of these parameters  is so important  to 
the training  result that much of our time is wasted on these parameters.  
So with Batch Normalization,  you don’t have to adjust the parameters  
very slowly. In addition,  once the neural network  is trained,  the param- 
eters will be updated.  Except the data of the input layer, the input data 
distribution  of each layer of the back network  is always changing.  Dur- 
ing training,  the update of the training  parameters  of the previous  layer 
will lead to the change of the input data distribution  of the later layer. 
Take the second layer of the network  as an example:  the input of the 
second layer of the network  is calculated  by the parameters  and input 
of the ﬁrst layer. However,  the parameters  of the ﬁrst layer are always 
changing  during the whole training  process,  so it is inevitable  to change 
the distribution  of the input data of each subsequent  layer. We refer 
to changes  in the data distribution  of the network  middle layer during 
training  as "Internal  Covariate  Shift". The Normalization  is designed  to 
deal with the change in the middle data distribution  during training.  
BN, like activation  function  layer, convolution  layer, full connection  
layer and pooling  layer, also belongs  to a layer of network.  The essential  
principle  of BN is that when each layer of the network  is input, another  
normalization  layer is inserted.  In other words, the normalization  pro- 
cessing is performed  ﬁrst. The Normalization  sets a batch of data with 
a mean of 0 and a variance  of 1, and then goes to the next layer of the 
network.  
One layer has d dimensional  input: 𝑥 = ( 𝑥 (1) ⋯ 𝑥 ( 𝑑) ) , Normalize  each 
dimension:  
̂𝑥 ( 𝑘 ) = 𝑥 𝑘 − 𝐸 [𝑥 ( 𝑘 ) ]
√ 
𝑉 𝑎𝑟 [𝑥 ( 𝑘 ) ](2) 
If only the above normalization  formula  is used to normalize  the out- 
put data of layer A of the network,  and then it is sent to the next layer 
of network  B, then the features  learned  at the layer of network  A will 
be aﬀected.  For example,  the network  data in the middle of a layer is 
itself characterized  by being distributed  on both sides of the Sigmoid  
activation  function,  normalized  to set its variance  to 1, and converted  
its distribution  to the middle of the Sigmoid  activation  function.  This 
is equivalent  to breaking  the characteristic  distribution  learned  by this 
layer of the network.  Therefore,  the learnable  parameters  𝛾, 𝛽are intro- 
duced to transform  and reconstruct:  
𝑦 ( 𝑘 ) = 𝛾( 𝑘 ) ̂𝑥 ( 𝑘 ) + 𝛽( 𝑘 ) (3) 
𝛾( 𝑘 ) = √ 
𝑉 𝑎𝑟 [𝑥 ( 𝑘 ) ](4) 
𝛽( 𝑘 ) = 𝐸 [𝑥 ( 𝑘 ) ](5) 
The above formula  shows that the learned  reconstruction  parameters  
can restore the features  of the original  layer. Fig. 5 displays  the batch 
normalization  process.  Among  them, μis mean of x in mini-batch,  σis Fig. 6. Rectiﬁed  Linear Unit.

weights..  
3.4. Rectiﬁed  linear unit 
The activation  function  is used to add nonlinear  factors,  because  the 
linear model is not expressive  enough.  Assuming  that if there are no acti- 
vation functions,  the input of each node at each layer is a linear function  
of the output at the upper layer, it’s easy to verify that no matter how 
many layers you have in your neural network,  the output is a linear 
combination  of the input. This is equivalent  to no hidden layer, which 
means that each layer without  activation  function  is equivalent  to matrix 
multiplication  ( Huang,  2018 ; Pan, 2018 ). Even if you add layers, you’re 
just multiplying  matrices.  Then the network  approximation  capability  is 
quite limited.  Because  of the above reasons,  we decided  to use nonlinear  
function  as activation  function,  so that the deep neural network  expres-  
sion ability is more powerful,  no longer a linear combination  of inputs, 
but can approximate  almost any function.  The expression  for ReLU is as 
follows.  
𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ( 0 , 𝑥 ) (6) 
It is obvious  from the expression  (6) and the graph Fig. 6 that ReLU 
is a function  to get a maximum  value. ReLU is a piecewise  function  
that turns all negative  values into 0, but the positive  values remain the 
same, and this operation  is called unilateral  inhibition.  In other words, 
if the input is negative,  it will output zero, so the neuron will not be 
activated.  This means that only a few neurons  are activated  at the same 
time, making  the network  sparse and thus very eﬃcient  for computing  
( Nayak, Das, Dash, Majhi & Majhi, 2020 ; Olimov  et al., 2021 ). Because  
of this unilateral  inhibition,  neurons  in the neural network  also have 
sparse activation.  This is especially  reﬂected  in the deep neural network  
model such as CNN. When N layers are added to the model, the activa- 
tion rate of neurons  will theoretically  decrease  by 2 to the NTH power. 
The advantages  of using the ReLU function  are as follows:  1) There is 
no saturation  region and no gradient  disappearance.  2) Without  com- 
plex exponential  operation,  the calculation  is simple and the eﬃciency  
is improved  3) The actual convergence  speed is much faster than Sig- 
moid/ Tanh. 4) It is more consistent  with the biological  neural activation  
mechanism  than Sigmoid.

3.5. ResNet-50  
The ﬁrst problem  with increasing  depth is gradient  explo- 
sion/dissipation,  which is due to the fact that as the number  of layers 
increases,  the gradient  back propagating  in the network  will become  
unstable  with the multiplications  and become  very large or very small. 
One of the problems  that often arises is gradient  dissipation  ( Kwon, Pel- 
lauer, Parashar  & Krishna,  2021 ; Lee, Kim & Jung, 2021 ). In order to 
overcome  gradient  dissipation,  many solutions  have been found, such 
as using Batch Normalization,  changing  activation  function  to ReLU, 
and using Xaiver initialization,  etc. It can be said that gradient  dissipa-  
tion has been well solved. Another  problem  with the network  deepening  
is degradation,  that is, the performance  of the network  is worse as the 
depth increases.  From experience,  the depth of the network  is crucial to 
the performance  of the model. When the number  of network  layers is 
increased,  the network  can carry out more complex  feature pattern  ex- 
traction,  so better results can be obtained  theoretically  when the model 
is deeper.  However,  the experiment  found that the deep network  was 
degenerating.  With the increase  of network  depth, the accuracy  of the 
network  tends to be saturated  or even decreased.  There is a decrease  in 
the accuracy  of the training  set. We can determine  that this is not caused 
by overﬁtting.  Because  the accuracy  of the training  set should be high 
in the case of overﬁtting.  The residual  network  in ResNet is designed  
to solve this problem,  and after solving  this problem,  the depth of the 
network  rises by several orders of magnitude.  
ResNet proposed  two kinds of mapping:  one is identity  mapping,  
referring  to the "curved  curve" in Fig. 7 , and the other residual  map- 
ping refers to the part except the "curved  curve", so the ﬁnal output is 
y = F (x) + x . Identity  mapping,  as the name implies,  refers to itself, which 
is x in the formula,  while residual  mapping  refers to "diﬀerence",  that 
is, y − x , so residual  refers to F(x). At ﬁrst, ResNet-50  performed  convo- 
lution operation  on the input, followed  by 4 residual  blocks, and ﬁnally 
performed  full connection  operation  to achieve  classiﬁcation  tasks. The 
network  structure  of ResNet-50  is shown in Fig. 8 , which has 50 Conv2D  
operations.  
Fully connected  (FC) layer usually  appears  at the end of the CNN 
to summarize  the features  of the previous  layers ( Ali, Janabi-Shariﬁ&  
Beheshti,  2021 ). If we take the previous  convolution  and pooling  as 
the process  of feature engineering,  local ampliﬁcation  and local feature 
extraction,  the latter FC layer can be thought  of as feature weighting.  
The structure  of the FC layer shown in Fig. 9 is usually  a way to 
quickly  learn the nonlinear  combinations  of advanced  attributes  gen- 
erated by the convolutional  layer. The FC layer will learn a possible  Fig. 9. The structure  of FC layer. 
nonlinear  function.  The basic procedure  of learning  is as follows.  First, 
the image, which has been converted  into a form suitable  for multilevel  
perceptron  ( Togacar,  Ergen & Comert,  2020 ), is ﬂattened  into column  
vectors  and fed back to the feed forward  neural network.  The ﬂattened  
data is then applied  to each iteration  of the training.  In this way, the 
model has the ability to distinguish  between  the major features  in the 
image and some low-level  features  and classify  them through  classiﬁca-  
tion techniques  such as Softmax.  Here we will output the classiﬁcation  
results of the seven expressions  ( Figs. 10 and 11 ). 
3.6. Measure  
In the experimental  process,  in order to avoid the phenomenon  of 
overﬁtting,  we choose the cross-validation  technique  of 10 groups.  Each 
group contained  10 images of seven emotions:  happy, sadness,  fear, 
anger, surprise,  disgust and neutral.  Eight of these groups were used 
for training,  one for validation,  and the remaining  one for testing.  For a 
more concise  representation,  we introduce  the confusion  matrix (CM). 
Therefore,  the ideal 𝐻( 𝑟 = 1 , 𝑔 = 1 ) should be as follows:  
H ( 𝑟 = 1 , 𝑔 = 1 ) = ⎡ 
⎢ 
⎢ 
⎢

Here, 𝐻is the confusion  matrix,  𝑟 is the number  of iterations,  and 𝑔is 
the number  of groups.  The above matrix is the representation  of 1 group 
of ideal confusion  matrices  in 1 iteration.  In particular,  𝐻 𝑖𝑗 represents

Here, the elements  on the diagonal  of 𝐻( 𝑟 = 1 , 𝑔 = 10 ) are the struc- 
ture of matrix summation  for the test sets of 10 experiment  groups.  In 
general,  in order to improve  the accuracy  of the experiment  and reduce 
the error, we will implement  10 runs and summarize  CM. Thus, the ideal 𝐻( 𝑟 = 10 , 𝑔 = 10 ) can be obtained  as:

4. Experiment  result and discussions  
4.1. Statistical  analysis  
The sensitivity  analysis  is shown in Table 1 .These data correlate  
closely with the facial muscles  that correspond  to the expression,  with 
funnel-shaped  lips and nasal wrinkles  making  their early facial expres-  
sions similar,  and expressions  such as drooping  jaws and lifting upper 
eyelids making  expressions  based on the same muscle movement  char- 
acteristics  similar.  
According  to the data in Table 1 , the sensitivity  analysis  of the seven 
facial expressions  running  ten times is as follows:95.50  ± 2.32%, 
94.50 ± 2.22%, 95.70 ± 2.06%, 95.90 ± 2.69%, 96.40 ± 1.84%, 
94.10 ± 4.15%, 95.60 ± 2.12%. From this we can conclude  that neu- 
tral expressions  are the most sensitive  and easily recognized,  followed  
by happy and fear. As can be seen from Table 2 , the overall average  
accuracy  of the system after 10 runs is 95.39 ± 1.41%. 
4.2. Comparison  with state-of-the-art  approaches  
The OA of "ResNet-50  ″ method  used in this experiment  was com- 
pared with that of the other three methods,  HWT ( Evans, 2017 ), 
CSO ( Yang, 2017 ) and BBO ( Li, 2020 ). The results are shown in 
Table 3: The OA of HWT ( Evans, 2017 ) is 78.37 ± 1.50%;The  OA 
of CSO ( Yang, 2017 ) is 89.49 ± 0.76%;The  OA of BBO ( Li, 2020 ) is Table 3 
Comparison  with State-of-the-art  methods.  
Method OA 
HWT ( Evans, 2017 ) 78.37 ± 1.50 
CSO ( Yang, 2017 ) 89.49 ± 0.76 
BBO ( Li, 2020 ) 93.79 ± 1.24 
ResNet-50  (Ours) 95.39 ± 1.41 
93.79 ± 1.24%.We  can clearly see that "ResNet-50  ″ method  has the 
highest  accuracy  (95.39 ± 1.41%),  followed  by BBO ( Li, 2020 ), CSO 
( Yang, 2017 ), and HWT ( Evans, 2017 ). 
It can be seen from Table 1 that "ResNet-50  ″ method  obtains  the 
highest  OA mainly depends  on: the existence  of residual  module  of 
ResNet-50  solves the problem  of network  degradation,  and its network  
is relatively  deep combined  with convolution,  which has good ability of 
feature extraction  and excellent  training  ability. The second best method  
is the BBO ( Li, 2020 ) algorithm,  which is inspired  by biogeography  and 
uses migration  and mutation  to update data. Species  will move from the 
habitat with higher HIS (habitat  suitability  index) values to the habitat 
with lower HIS values in order to improve  the habitability  of the habitat 
with lower HIS values. The core of BBO algorithm  is the population  mi- 
gration  and variation  between  diﬀerent  habitats.  These two operations  
are also the main steps to achieve  the optimization  eﬀect in the pro- 
cess of solving  the problem.  The third best method  is CSO ( Yang, 2017 ), 
which is a new group optimization  algorithm  based on the predator-  
prey strategy  of cats, it mainly realizes  global optimization  through  the 
combination  of search mode and tracking  mode. To solve the optimiza-  
tion problem  by using cat swarm algorithm,  the number  of individuals  
involved  in the optimization  calculation  should be determined  ﬁrst. Af- 
ter the cats have gone through  the search mode and the tracking  mode, 
their ﬁtness is calculated  based on the ﬁtness function  and the best solu- 
tion in the current  group is retained.  Then, according  to the MR (Mixture  
Ratio), the cat group was randomly  divided  into the searching  part and 
the tracking  part, and the iterative  calculation  was carried out by this 
method  until the preset number  of iterations  was reached.  
In this experiment,  the ResNet-50  network  has achieved  good results 
compared  with other methods.  Next, we will try to use diﬀerent  layers 
of ResNet as well as several variants  of ResNet,  such as Wide Residual  
Network  (WRN),  ResNeXt  and MobileNet  to study facial emotion  recog- 
nition. In the future work, we will test their performance.  
5. Conclusion  
In this paper, an improved  facial expression  recognition  system is 
studied  and a facial expression  recognition  method  based on deep resid- 
ual network  is proposed.  This paper focuses  on the learning  process  of 
facial expression  recognition.  We use the current  popular  convolutional  
neural network  algorithm,  combined  with the ResNet-50  residual  net- 
work, which has achieved  a good eﬀect in the multi-classiﬁcation  task. 
Through  the validation  of the data set, the experimental  results show 
63 B. Li and D. Lima International  Journal of Cognitive Computing  in Engineering  2 (2021) 57–64 
that the method  proposed  in this paper has good accuracy  and good 
recognition  eﬀect in terms of average  recognition  accuracy.  
In the future research,  we will focus on the research  of facial emo- 
tion recognition  and try to collect more emotional  images than in this 
experiment,  so as to optimize  and propose  a better algorithm  to train the 
hyperparameter  of multi-layer  feedforward  neural network,  such as the 
weights  and biases. And we will also try such optimization  algorithms  
based on the method  mentioned  above to improve  the performance  of 
multi-layer  feedforward  neural network.  We will continue  to explore  
ways based on deep residual  network  to improve  the accuracy  of facial 
expression  recognition.
