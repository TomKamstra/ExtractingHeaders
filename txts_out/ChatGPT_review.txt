Abstract— Literature review articles are essential to 
summarize the related work in the selected field. However, 
covering all related studies takes too much time and effort. This 
study question s how Artificial Intelligence can be used in this 
process. We used ChatGPT to create a literature review article 
to show the stage of the OpenAI ChatGPT artificial intelligence 
application. As the subject, the applications of Digital Twin in 
the health fie ld were chosen. Abstracts of the last three years 
(2020, 2021 and 2022) papers were obtained from the keyword 
"Digital twin in healthcare" search results on Google Scholar 
and paraphrased by ChatGPT. Later on, we asked ChatGPT 
questions. The results are pr omising; however, the paraphrased 
parts had significant matches when checked with the Ithenticate 
tool. This article is the first attempt to show the compilation and 
expression of knowledge will be accelerated with the help of 
artificial intelligence. We a re still at the beginning of such 
advances. The future academic publishing process will require 
less human effort, which in turn will allow academics to focus 
on their studies. In future studies, we will monitor citations to 
this study to evaluate the acad emic validity of the content 
produced by the ChatGPT.  
Keywords — OpenAI, ChatGPT, Artificial Intelligence, Digital 
twin, Healthcare, ChatGPT revolution, Academic Publishing  
I. INTRODUCTION  
OpenAI ChatGPT [1] is a chatbot based on the OpenAI 
GPT -3 language model. It is designed to generate human -like 
text responses to user input in a conversational context. 
OpenAI ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of human 
conversations and can be used to create responses to a wide 
range of topics and prompts. Th e chatbot can be used for 
customer service, content creation, and language translation 
tasks, creating replies in multiple languages. OpenAI 
ChatGPT is available through the OpenAI API, which allows 
developers to access and integrate the chatbot into their  
applications and systems.  
OpenAI ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pre -
trained Transformer) language model developed by OpenAI. 
It is designed to generate human -like text, allowing it to 
engage in conversation with users naturally and intuitivel y. 
OpenAI ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of human 
conversations, allowing it to understand and respond to a wide 
range of topics and contexts. It can be used in various 
applications, such as chatbots, customer service agents, and 
language translatio n systems. OpenAI ChatGPT is a state -of-
the-art language model able to generate coherent and natural 
text that can be indistinguishable from text written by a 
human.  
As an artificial intelligence, ChatGPT may need help to 
change academic writing practices.  However, it can provide 
information and guidance on ways to improve people’s academic writing skills. People can improve the quality of 
their academic writing and effectively communicate their 
ideas to readers by following the following few tips:  
• Unders tand the purpose of people’s writing: Is it to
inform, persuade, or analyse? Identifying the goal will help 
them choose the appropriate tone, style, and structure for their 
writing.  
• Use clear and concise language: Avoid jargon and
use simple, straightfor ward language to convey your ideas 
effectively.  
• Use evidence to support their claims: It is essential to
provide evidence to support your ideas and arguments in 
academic writing. Use credible sources and provide proper 
citations to support their claims.  
• Use proper structure: Organise their writing into
clear sections and use headings and subheadings to guide the 
reader through their argument.  
• Edit and proofread: Make sure to proofread their
writing for grammar and spelling errors and edit for clarity and 
concision.  
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technological development 
that will significantly impact daily life and legal regulations, 
including civil, criminal, and liability laws. One area where AI 
will affect is the regulation of intellectual prope rty rights. 
There is a question of who should own patents for inventions 
made by AI machines [2]. Who owns the AI - generated 
articles? Is it the person who asks the information and 
questions necessary to write the essay, or is it the sof tware and 
machine that creates this content? These and many other 
questions need to be answered.  
In this study, it is evaluated whether an academic article 
can be created by AI and whether the created article carries 
values such as academic content and ori ginality. All content 
except the “Abstract”, “Introduction”, “Method”, “Findings 
and Results” and “Discussion and Conclusion” subsections 
was generated by ChatGPT. Another purpose of this study is 
to analyse the number of citations this article will receiv e and 
the characteristics of the citations. When the required sample 
size for the citations is reached (at least 100 journal article 
citations), we will examine the studies referring to this article 
and the effectiveness, and academic validity of the paper  will 
be interpreted through citations.  
In the first following section, used methods are given. In 
the second section one of the new technologies Digital Twin 
was defined by ChatGPT . In the third section, information 
about the use and features of Digital Twin in HealthCare is 
Cite (APA): Aydın, Ö. , Karaarslan, E.  (2022). OpenAI ChatGPT  Generated Literature Review: Digital Twin in

23 shared by ChatGPT. In the fourth part, the abstracts of the 
articles that were found as a result of the search for "Digital 
Twin in Healthcare" and that could b e accessed via Google 
Scholar belonging the last 3 years were paraphrased by 
ChatGPT. In the fifth section, the findings and results are 
given. Finally, the study ends with the evaluations made by us 
under the title of Discussion and Conclusion.  
II. METHOD  
It is useful to reiterate the aim of doing this study here. 
ChatGPT is an important example of how artificial 
intelligence can produce results in academic article writing. 
Therefore, we aim to ensure that a review article is written by 
artificial intelligence  at a basic level and to question its 
academic validity. For this purpose, as a research method, it 
was determined that the abstracts of the results obtained by 
searching on a topic (Digital Twin in Healthcare) that we 
determined on Google Scholar should b e paraphrased with 
ChatGPT. Also, "What is Digital Twin?" and "Digital Twin in 
Healthcare" was queried to ChatGPT to generate for the 
Digital Twin and Healthcare topics. These two titles are 
included in the article before the literature title.  
The texts cr eated by ChatGPT by paraphrasing and the 
texts produced by giving the answers are checked by 
plagiarism tools such as Ithenticate, intihal.net and alike. As a 
result of the evaluation, an evaluation is made on the similarity 
rate with the previous studies.  
In order to evaluate the Academic Validity of this study, 
the following method was determined. This article has been 
published on the preprint sharing environments (SSRN, 
Arxiv, Techxriv, Researchgate, Academia etc.). Citations to 
this study will be recor ded then. Finally, these articles will be 
reviewed and evaluated when the citations reach a certain 
number (for example, 100 journal article citations). The 
academic validity of this text produced by ChatGPT will be 
evaluated from the criticisms and evalua tions in these 
citations.  
III. DIGITAL TWIN 
A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical 
object or system that allows for the simulation of the object or 
system's behaviour, performance, and characteristics. This 
technology has the potential to revo lutionize a wide range of 
industries, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and 
urban planning.  
The concept of a digital twin originated in the 
manufacturing industry, where it was used to optimize the 
design and operation of complex systems such as aircraft 
engines and industrial machinery. Today, digital twins are 
being applied to a much more comprehensive range of 
applications, including infrastructure, buildings, and even 
entire cities.  
One of the key benefits of digital twins is their ability to 
provide real -time data and insights into the performance and 
behaviour of a physical object or system. These insights allow 
for the identification of problems and inefficiencies in real -
time, enabling proactive maintenance and optimization of the 
system . In manufacturing, we can use digital twins to optimize 
production, reduce downtime, and improve efficiency. For 
example, a digital twin of a factory floor can be used to 
simulate and optimize the flow of materials, identify 
bottlenecks, and minimize wast e. 
In healthcare, we can use digital twins to simulate and 
optimize patient care pathways, reducing the risk of medical 
errors and improving outcomes. We can also use digital twins 
to optimize the design and operation of healthcare facilities, 
such as hosp itals and clinics.  
In urban planning, we can use digital twins to simulate and 
optimize the design and operation of entire cities, including 
transportation systems, energy networks, and public services. 
These optimizations can help cities to become more ef ficient, 
sustainable, and liveable.  
Overall, digital twins have the potential to transform a wide 
range of industries and applications by providing real -time 
data and insights that can be used to optimize the performance 
and behaviour of physical objects a nd systems. As technology 
advances, digital twins will likely become increasingly 
prevalent in many sectors.  
IV. DIGITAL TWIN IN HEALTHCARE  
Digital twins have the potential to revolutionize healthcare 
by providing real -time data and insights that can be used t o 
optimize patient care pathways and improve outcomes. 
Several key themes emerge in a review of the literature on 
digital twins in healthcare.  
One of the main benefits of digital twins in healthcare is 
their ability to provide real -time data and insights i nto patient 
care. By simulating and optimizing patient care pathways, 
digital twins can help to reduce the risk of medical errors and 
improve patient outcomes. For example, a digital twin of a 
patient's medical history and current condition can be used to 
identify potential problems and inefficiencies in the care 
process, enabling proactive intervention and optimization of 
care.  
Another key benefit of digital twins in healthcare is their 
ability to support remote monitoring and telemedicine. By 
providing re al-time data on patient vital signs and other health 
indicators, digital twins can enable healthcare providers to 
monitor patients remotely and provide care remotely, reducing 
the need for in -person visits and improving access to care.  
We can also use digi tal twins to optimize the design and 
operation of healthcare facilities, such as hospitals and clinics. 
By simulating and optimizing the flow of patients, staff, and 
resources within a facility, digital twins can help to improve 
efficiency, reduce wait tim es, and improve patient 
satisfaction.  
Overall, using digital twins in healthcare can transform the 
way healthcare is delivered, enabling more personalized, 
efficient, and effective care. As technology advances, digital 
twins will likely become increasingly  prevalent in healthcare, 
providing valuable data and insights that can be used to 
optimize patient care and improve outcomes.  Aydin  and Karaarslan  
24 V. LITERATURE REVIEW  
There has been a significant increase in the use of digital 
healthcare services, such as personalized medicine,  
telemedicine, and smart diet management, in recent years. 
These services often have diverse requirements, and require 
intelligent analytics and self -sustaining networks in order to 
function effectively. Digital twins can help to enable 
proactive, intellig ent analytics and self -sustaining networks in 
healthcare, allowing for the efficient management of resources 
and minimum interaction from end -users or network 
operators. In this article, we provide an overview of digital 
twins in healthcare, including a pr oposed architecture and 
several use cases. We also identify open research challenges 
and potential solutions.  
The proposed digital twin -based system for monitoring 
COVID -19 symptoms uses mobile phones to collect data, 
which is fed into a digital copy of ea ch individual stored in the 
cloud. This digital twin is continually updated with real -time 
measurements from sensors and other devices, and is analyzed 
using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques 
to determine the individual's health statu s. The system also 
utilizes blockchain technology to ensure the confidentiality of 
the data, which can be shared for research purposes with the 
consent of the individual. The goal of the system is to provide 
early diagnosis and prevent the spread of the di sease by 
establishing a protocol for following up with patients and 
those at risk [3]. 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality from non - communicable diseases 
worldwide. In many cases, effective a cute care and risk factor 
management strategies based on data from epidemiological 
studies and clinical trials have improved survival and quality 
of life. However, approximately half of all myocardial 
infarction and stroke events occur in patients who do n ot meet 
the criteria for cholesterol -lowering treatment, and costly 
preventive therapies with potential side effects may be given 
unnecessarily. Improving outcomes in cardiology therefore 
requires a better understanding of individual susceptibility and 
prognosis [4]. 
Data -driven approaches to risk assessment and treatment 
are central to the goals of precision medicine, which aims to 
disrupt traditional healthcare practices by providing early, 
customized therapy that considers molecular, ge netic, 
physical, and environmental data profiles. While prediction 
and personalization have always been a part of medicine, the 
convergence of 21st century technologies with advances in 
biomedicine is enabling the consolidation and analysis of 
large amount s of data from a wide range of sources using 
massive data networks. Improvements in clinical data capture, 
imaging, and molecular phenotyping also contribute to the 
goal of precision medicine. The ability to process large data 
sets digitally has greatly en hanced the utility of this data  [4]. 
The health digital twin builds on these capabilities by 
using a virtual replica to receive a patient's molecular, 
physiological, and lifestyle data, allowing for risk prediction 
and personalized treatm ent for the real -life patient. Artificial 
intelligence helps link the cyber, physical, and data domains 
to create virtual models by using technologies such as cloud 
computing, big data processing, machine learning, and pattern recognition to mimic human re asoning. These core 
technologies can also assist in decision -making for a patient 
by synthesizing data from multiple real -world sources within 
a virtual domain. Digital twins can be created at various levels, 
including the whole body, a single organ, or th e cellular level, 
and can be used to study specific conditions or settings, such 
as cancer or critical care. An individual's digital twin can be 
copied and tested with different treatments to determine the 
optimal intervention. By aggregating digital twins  from many 
individuals with diverse genetic, biomedical, and lifestyle 
profiles, a population -based database can be created, which 
can be used for data -driven prevention and patient matching 
for clinical trials conducted in silico as an alternative to 
lengthy or costly animal and human studies [4]. 
In a paper by Volkow et al., it is noted that as the 
population grows, the need for high -quality medical services 
and the use of information technology in medicine also 
increases. The concept of  Smart Healthcare aims to address 
the challenges faced in modern healthcare through various 
approaches, including the use of digital twins, the Internet of 
Things, and mobile medicine. The paper reviews the main 
problems in modern healthcare and analyses e xisting 
approaches and technologies in these areas. It also discusses 
the key features of modern platforms that support Mobile 
Health Applications. Based on this analysis, the authors 
propose the concept of a Smart Healthcare Platform, focused 
on supportin g the development of Mobile Health Applications 
through the organization, management, and sharing of user 
data [5]. 
While Digital Twin technology has been applied in a 
variety of fields, including advanced manufacturing, Product 
Lifecycle Managem ent (PLM), and smart healthcare, this 
paper discusses the potential use of Digital Twin for full 
lifecycle management of humans. The concept of an 
Augmented Digital Twin is introduced as the foundation for 
the concept of a Human Digital Twin (HDT), which i s the 
central focus of the paper. Drawing on the experience of using 
Digital Twin in smart manufacturing, PLM, and smart 
healthcare, as well as the development of related technologies 
such as data mining, data fusion analysis, artificial 
intelligence, part icularly deep learning, and human -computer 
science, it is concluded that HDT could be a useful approach 
to full lifecycle health management and that it is possible to 
construct a Human Digital Twin, particularly from a 
technological standpoint. A compariso n between Digital Twin 
and Human Digital Twin demonstrates this possibility. The 
paper presents the concept, conceptual model, and 
characteristics of HDT to lay the groundwork for its 
construction. It also discusses how to construct a Human 
Digital Twin by  proposing a Human Digital Twin System 
Architecture and Implementation Approach. However, it is 
noted that there are many challenges to overcome in this 
process, including extreme complexity and security and social 
ethics issues [6]. 
Personaliz ed medicine involves using detailed information 
about individual people to identify deviations from the 
normal. Digital twins in engineering provide a framework for 
analysing these data -driven healthcare practices and their 
ethical and societal implication s for therapy, preventative 
care, and human enhancement. Digital twins are pairs of Aydin  and Karaarslan  
25 individual physical artifacts and digital models that 
dynamically reflect the status of the artifacts. Ethical and 
societal implications of digital twins are examined, and it is 
noted that they have the potential to deliver significant societal 
benefits and function as a social equalizer by allowing for 
effective, equalizing enhancement interventions. Digital twins 
will be important for providing highly personalized treatmen ts 
and interventions, and they rely on explainable artificial 
intelligence [7]. 
Anticipating the ethical impact of emerging technologies 
is an important aspect of responsible innovation, and the 
digital twin is one such technology that is emerging . A digital 
twin is a living replica of a physical system (human or non -
human) that combines various emerging technologies such as 
artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, big data, and 
robotics, each of which brings its own ethical issues. This 
report presents the results of a qualitative study on the ethical 
benefits and risks of using digital twins in healthcare. The 
study used insights from the ethics of technology and the 
Quadruple Helix theory of innovation, and included desk 
research of white  literature and 23 interviews with 
representatives from industry, research, policy, and civil 
society. The results showed that digital twins have the 
potential to produce ethical benefits in areas such as the 
prevention and treatment of disease, cost reduc tion, patient 
autonomy and freedom, and equal treatment, but also have 
ethical risks in areas such as privacy and data property, 
disruption of existing societal structures, inequality, and 
injustice. The report concludes with a reflection on the 
analytical  tool used and suggestions for further research [8]. 
In a paper by Elayan et al., it is noted that the use of digital 
technologies in the healthcare industry, known as digital and 
smart healthcare, has increased in recent years in an effort to 
improve patient care, increase life expectancy, and reduce 
healthcare costs. One such technology that has the potential to 
significantly impact the field is digital twin (DT) technology. 
DT is a virtual replica of a physical asset that reflects its 
current st atus through real - time data. The paper proposes and 
implements an intelligent context -aware healthcare system 
using DT technology. As part of this system, an 
electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rhythms classifier model was 
built using machine learning to diagno se heart disease and 
detect heart problems. The results showed that integrating DT 
with healthcare can improve the healthcare process by 
bringing patients and healthcare professionals together in an 
intelligent, comprehensive, and scalable health ecosystem . 
Additionally, the implementation of the ECG classifier 
demonstrated the potential for using machine learning and 
artificial intelligence with various human body metrics for 
continuous monitoring and abnormalities detection. The paper 
also found that neur al network -based algorithms perform 
better on ECG data than traditional machine learning 
algorithms [9]. 
The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming 
increasingly prevalent, with the widespread use of smart 
medical devices and applica tions in smart hospitals, home 
healthcare, and nursing homes. It combines smart medical 
devices, cloud computing services, and core Internet of Things 
(IoT) technologies to monitor patients' vital signs, track health 
conditions, and generate multivariate d ata to support on -demand healthcare. Typically, this large amount of data is 
analyzed on centralized servers. However, anomaly detection 
(AD) in centralized healthcare systems can be slow and 
resource -intensive, and there are also privacy concerns related 
to sending patients' personal health data to a centralized 
server, which can also introduce security risks such as the 
possibility of data poisoning. To address these issues with 
centralized AD models, the authors propose a federated 
learning (FL) -based AD  model that uses edge cloudlets to run 
AD models locally without sharing patients' data. While 
existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single 
server, which limits their scope, they introduce a hierarchical 
FL approach that enables aggregation at di fferent levels and 
multi -party collaboration. They also propose a novel disease -
based grouping mechanism for organizing different AD 
models based on specific types of diseases. In addition, they 
develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) 
Long Sh ort-Term Memory (LSTM) approach for training the 
AD model. They present a remote patient monitoring (RPM) 
use case to demonstrate our model and provide a proof -of-
concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge 
cloudlets [10]. 
As the  proportion of the aging population increases, the 
need for sustainable, high -quality, and timely healthcare 
services has become increasingly pressing, particularly in 
light of the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020. To meet this 
demand, a promising strategy is to introduce cloud computing 
and digital twin techniques into healthcare systems. In this 
approach, a cloud server is used to store healthcare data and 
provide efficient query services, while a digital twin is used to 
build a digital representation of a patie nt and leverage the 
query services of the cloud server to monitor the healthcare 
state of the patient. While several cloud computing and digital 
twin- based healthcare monitoring frameworks have been 
proposed, none have addressed data privacy concerns, eve n 
though the leakage of private healthcare information could 
have catastrophic consequences for patients. To address this 
challenge, this paper proposes an efficient and privacy -
preserving similarity query -based healthcare monitoring 
scheme over a digital twin cloud platform, called PSim -DTH. 
The scheme employs a partition -based tree to index the 
healthcare data and uses matrix encryption to propose a 
privacy -preserving PB -tree-based similarity range query 
algorithm. Security analysis and performance evalua tion are 
conducted, and the results show that the proposed PSim -DTH 
scheme is both privacy -preserving and efficient  [11]. 
In the future, it is possible that a digital twin of each 
person's genetic profile will be created at birth. If someo ne 
becomes ill, this virtual representation of themselves could be 
treated with a vast number of drugs using computational 
methods to determine the most effective medication. The 
digital twin could also be used to predict which medical 
conditions a person may be at risk for, allowing them to take 
preventive measures to avoid major diseases before they occur 
[12]. 
The process of digitization and digitalization has already 
had a significant impact on our world, and further disruptions 
are expected as  digital transformation continues, with digital 
twins playing a key role. As big data techniques, the Internet 
of Things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence Aydin  and Karaarslan  
26 algorithms advance, digital twin technology is experiencing 
rapid development and has bee n identified as one of the top 
ten most promising technologies. Although it is still in its early 
stages, digital twins are already being widely used in various 
fields, particularly in industry, smart cities, and smart health, 
which are the areas that attr act the most research. There are 
numerous articles and reviews on digital twins published 
every year in these three fields, making it timely and necessary 
to provide an analysis of the published work. This article aims 
to do just that, providing a survey o f the major research and 
application areas of digital twins. It begins by analyzing the 
recent developments of digital twins, then summarizes the 
theoretical foundations of the technology, and concludes with 
specific developments in various application are as of digital 
twins. The article also discusses the challenges that may be 
encountered in the future  [13]. 
Digital Twins (DTs) are becoming more widespread in 
various industries due to advances in computing power and 
data science. There are m any sensors and connected devices 
that generate data, which can be used to create a digital model 
of a system or object and predict and simulate various 
scenarios. DTs have recently been adapted for use in the 
healthcare industry for accurate medical simul ations and 
resource management, but the technology is still relatively 
new to the healthcare system and there are concerns about 
security threats. This paper proposes a Blockchain -based 
secure Digital Twin framework for a smart healthy city as a 
solution t o these threats. The paper also discusses the current 
COVID -19 pandemic as a case study and suggests that DTs 
can be used to control the situation, prevent future cases, and 
personalize treatment [14]. 
De Maeyer and Markopoulos study h ow experts in the 
digital transformation of healthcare envision the use of Digital 
Twins.  Digital Twins are digital replicas of physical assets, 
processes, people, places, systems, and devices that can be 
used for scientific experiments, simulations, and predictions 
of intervention outcomes. They are a new technology with 
different implications and possibilities for different 
applications, and may evolve in various ways. The authors 
used the Delphi method to reach a consensus among experts 
on three researc h questions related to the materialization, 
expectations, and implementation of Digital Twins in 
healthcare. The main conclusion is that Digital Twins are seen 
as a way to enable preventive healthcare and trial -and-error 
approaches to support personalized medicine and patient -
centered care [15]. 
De Maeyer and Markopoulos explore how experts in the 
digital transformation of healthcare envision the use of digital 
twins (DTs), which are digital replicas of physical assets, 
processes , people, places, systems, and devices that can be 
used for scientific experiments, simulations, and prediction of 
intervention outcomes. DTs are a new and evolving 
technology, and can be applied in different ways and for 
different purposes. To understand how DTs might develop 
and impact healthcare, the authors conducted a Delphi study 
and survey with experts to reach a consensus on how DTs 
might be materialized, what expectations there are for their 
use, and how they might be implemented in healthcare. The  
study aimed to identify the top ranked topics for further 
consideration [16]. One of the thesis investigates the potential use of digital 
twins in the healthcare industry as a means of predicting and 
preventing diseases. It exa mines the values and perspectives 
of individuals towards the use of digital twins in diagnosis, 
and proposes different forms or concepts that a digital twin 
could take in order to be meaningful to the user. The research 
found that the meaningfulness of a d igital twin may vary 
significantly based on factors such as age, life situation, 
preferences, and individual personality. It also found that the 
time, place, and frequency at which an individual interacts 
with a digital twin may be important considerations . The 
thesis concludes with guidelines for developing a more user -
centered and meaningful digital twin that takes into account 
the varied and dynamic nature of user values [17]. 
BOATĂ and other's paper summarizes the progress made 
in using the concept of digital twins to select the most 
appropriate medication for an individual, based on genetic 
expressions related to a particular disease and the genes 
targeted by therapy. The paper presents a subnet model that 
predicts existing drugs for a speci fic pathology. Finally, the 
paper discusses how the proposed method could be used to 
search for a medication for the disease caused by the Covid - 
19 virus, referencing the results of clinical trials conducted 
after the start of the pandemic [18]. 
Digital twin technology, which creates virtual 
representations of people, products, or buildings, has the 
potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by 
improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients, 
streamlining preventative care, and facilitating new 
approaches for hospital planning. In the future, it could be 
used to create a digital twin of each person's genetic profile at 
birth, allowing healthcare professionals to computationally 
test the most effective medications for an individua l and 
predict their risk for certain medical conditions. This could 
enable more personalized and preventative healthcare 
approaches [19]. 
Madubuike and Anumba’s research aims to examine how 
digital twin technology can be used to improve healthcar e 
facilities management. Currently, healthcare facilities 
management often relies on a reactive approach, where issues 
are only addressed when they arise. Digital twins, which are 
virtual representations of physical assets created using real -
time data, can  be used to monitor and manage critical 
healthcare facilities in a more preventive way. The research 
uses literature review and interviews to address its objectives 
and identify issues with critical healthcare facilities that can 
be addressed using digital  twin technology. It also reviews the 
technologies that enable digital twins and presents a system 
architecture for their use in healthcare facilities management. 
The research concludes by discussing the potential benefits of 
using digital twins in healthc are facilities management  [20]. 
Voigt et al. discuss the potential for digital twins to 
improve the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) by 
providing an individualized, innovative approach to disease 
management. They propose that d igital twins, which are 
virtual representations of a patient's characteristics created 
using artificial intelligence -based analysis of various disease 
parameters, could help healthcare professionals handle large 
amounts of patient data and provide more per sonalized, 
effective care by integrating data from multiple sources, Aydin  and Karaarslan  
27 implementing individualized clinical pathways, and 
facilitating communication and shared decision -making 
between patients and physicians. The authors also discuss the 
potential benefits o f using digital twins in MS management, 
including improved diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy, 
enhanced patient well - being, reduced economic costs, and 
prevention of disease progression. They argue that digital 
twins can help make precision medicine and p atient -centered 
care a reality in everyday practice [21]. 
A digital twin is a virtual representation of a real -life object 
or system that is connected to its physical counterpart in a way 
that allows for real -time data exchange and analysis . Digital 
twins are being used in various industries, and when applied 
to the fields of healthcare and public health, they have the 
potential to revolutionize traditional electronic health records 
by making them more precise and accurate. This technology 
allows for learning, hypothesis testing, and in silico 
experiments, and has the potential to enable highly 
personalized treatments and interventions in the future. This 
paper discusses the history and main concepts of digital twins, 
provides examples of the ir use in personal medicine, public 
health, and smart cities, and explores the technical and ethical 
challenges involved in their application [22]. 
Hussain et al. aims to demonstrate the use of a digital twin 
in healthcare, specif ically for stroke patients, using EEG data 
and machine learning techniques. The authors collected EEG 
data from 48 stroke patients and 75 healthy individuals using 
portable EEG devices and analyzed the data to identify 
characteristics that could be used to  distinguish between the 
two groups. They found that certain brain activity 
measurements were useful for classifying stroke patients and 
healthy individuals in different mental states, and used a 
machine learning model (SVM) to classify the data with 76% 
accuracy. The authors suggest that this digital twin framework 
could be used to help make clinical decisions related to stroke 
prevention and post -stroke treatment [23]. 
Healthcare technologies have seen increased use during 
the COVID -19 pandemic, including remote patient care and 
virtual follow -up. These technologies are likely to continue to 
be adapted in the future, both as a way to prepare for future 
pandemics and due to the advancement of artificial 
intelligence. This study looks at th e potential healthcare 
applications of digital twin technology, which involves 
creating a virtual counterpart to a physical model and studying 
the relationship between the two. It is proposed that digital 
twin technology could be used to analyze the relati onship 
between a physical cancer patient and their corresponding 
digital twin in order to predict and prevent neurological 
complications related to the disease. This approach is based 
on the idea that data science can be used to inform the 
diagnosis, treat ment planning, and prognosis of cancer care. 
Digital twin technology could be used in precision medicine, 
cancer care and treatment modeling, predictive analytics and 
machine learning, and to bring together different perspectives 
from clinicians [24]. 
In a paper by Alazab et al., it is noted that the landscape of 
digital healthcare, also known as Healthcare 4.0, has seen a 
significant increase in services such as personalized 
healthcare, intelligent rehabilitation, telemedicine, and smar t 
diet management. These services have diverse requirements that need to be met through proactive intelligent analytics and 
self-sustaining networks. Proactive intelligent analytics 
allows for the efficient management of resources in response 
to user reque sts, while self -sustaining networks operate with 
minimal interaction from end -users or network operators. To 
enable Healthcare 4.0 with these capabilities, digital twins can 
be utilized. The paper provides an overview and recent 
advancements in the use of digital twins for Healthcare 4.0, 
presents an architecture for digital twins in healthcare, and 
discusses several use cases. Additionally, the paper identifies 
open research challenges and possible solutions [25]. 
In recent years, Digital Twins technology has been 
introduced into the healthcare industry, bringing significant 
changes to the way medical care is provided. In this study, the 
authors propose a new disease diagnosis algorithm called the 
Factorization Machine Combine Product - based Neural 
Network (FMCPNN), which is an improved version of the 
Product -based Neural Network (PNN). PNN is an end -to-end 
Factorization Machine algorithm that is effective at handling 
sparse data, but it lacks the ability to handle low -order feature 
interact ions, which can limit its generalization capabilities. 
FMCPNN adds a second -order interaction component to 
PNN, improving its performance. FMCPNN can be 
effectively used in Digital Twin medical systems to improve 
the accuracy and speed of disease diagnosis . Their tests have 
shown that FMCPNN outperforms some other advanced 
models  [26]. 
Human digital twin (HDT) is a technology that has the 
potential to revolutionize the healthcare system by enabling 
personalized healthcare services (PHS) throug h the use of 
tools such as artificial intelligence and blockchain. Its 
implementation is expected to be similar to digital twins in 
other sectors, such as manufacturing and aviation, and will 
consist of three key dimensions: the physical entity, virtual 
model, and connection that characterizes the physical - virtual 
interactions. However, the complexity of the human body, 
with its constant molecular and physiological changes, makes 
it difficult to extract precise medical data and model HDTs. 
As a result, HDT  is more complex than other types of digital 
twins and the methods for implementing it are not yet clear, 
which requires further investigation. This paper presents the 
architectural framework and key design requirements for 
HDT, discusses the key technolog ies and technical challenges, 
and suggests future directions for research. It is believed that 
this paper will stimulate new research efforts towards the 
development of HDT for PHS [27]. 
Emotion recognition (ER) in healthcare has gained 
signifi cant attention due to recent advances in machine -
learning and deep -learning techniques. ER systems, combined 
with digital twins of individuals in real -time, can facilitate the 
monitoring, understanding, and improvement of physical 
capabilities, as well as provide constant input to improve 
quality of life and well -being for personalized healthcare. 
However, building such ER systems in real -time presents 
technical challenges such as limited datasets, occlusion and 
lighting issues, identifying important featur es, false 
classification of emotions, and high implementation costs. To 
address these challenges, a simple, efficient, and adaptable ER 
system was developed that acquires and processes images in 
real-time using a web camera. An end -to-end framework was Aydin  and Karaarslan  
28 also proposed that combines an ER system with a digital twin 
setup, allowing for the prediction and testing of results prior 
to providing the best possible personal healthcare treatment. 
The proposed ER system achieved promising results in a 
shorter training time without sacrificing accuracy. It is 
expected that in real -time, the system will be useful in 
healthcare centres for monitoring patients' health conditions, 
early diagnosis of life -threatening diseases, and obtaining the 
most effective treatment for pa tients during emergencies [28]. 
The digital world has seen significant growth in recent 
decades, and the COVID -19 pandemic has further accelerated 
this trend. Digital transformations are affecting all aspects of 
our lives, and new tec hnologies are constantly emerging and 
attracting attention and investment. Digital twin technology, 
which has gained significant popularity in recent years, is now 
being applied in the healthcare sector, which has been under 
scrutiny due to the COVID -19 pa ndemic. This paper aims to 
provide a better understanding of digital twin technology, 
address common misconceptions, and review the current state 
of digital twin applications in healthcare. It also summarizes 
the functions of digital twins at different sta ges of their use in 
the context of digital twin technology in healthcare. The paper 
proposes a model for using digital twin technology in 
healthcare based on the Internet of Things as a service concept 
and digital twinning as a service model supporting Ind ustry 
4.0. It also identifies different groups of physical entities that 
can be represented by digital twins in healthcare. The research 
discusses the value of digital twin technology in healthcare, as 
well as the current challenges and future research dir ections 
[29]. 
The concept of digital twins has the potential to transform 
the current healthcare system by making it more personalized. 
As a convergence of healthcare, artificial intelligence, and 
information and communication technologies , personalized 
healthcare services developed under the concept of digital 
twins raise a range of ethical issues. While some of these 
ethical issues are known to researchers in the field of digital 
health and personalized medicine, there is currently no 
comprehensive review that examines the major ethical risks of 
digital twins for personalized healthcare services. This study 
aims to address this gap by identifying the major ethical risks 
of digital twins for personalized healthcare services. A 
working defin ition of digital twins for personalized healthcare 
services is proposed, and a process -oriented ethical map is 
developed to identify the major ethical risks in each stage of 
data processing. A literature review of eHealth, personalized 
medicine, precision medicine, and information engineering is 
conducted to identify potential issues. The ethical map allows 
for the systematic identification of ethical concerns that 
emerge during the transformation of raw data into valuable 
information. Developers of digital  twins for personalized 
healthcare services can use this map to proactively identify 
and address ethical risks during the development stage. This 
paper provides a working definition of digital twins for 
personalized healthcare services, identifies 10 major  
operational problems and the corresponding ethical risks, and 
suggests a process -oriented ethical map to assist in the 
analysis of ethical risks [30]. 
Digital twins (DTs) are playing a vital role in transforming 
the healthcare industry by enabling more personalized, intelligent, and proactive healthcare. With the evolution of 
personalized healthcare, there is a need to create a virtual 
replica for individuals to provide the right type of care in the 
right way and at the right time. In this paper, the concept of a 
personal digital twin (PDT) as an enhanced version of a DT 
with actionable insight capabilities is examined. PDT can 
bring value to patients by enabling more accurate decision -
making and proper treatment selection and optimization. The 
progression of PDT as a revolutionary technology in 
healthcare research and industry is also explored. However, 
although there have been numerous research studies on the use 
of DTs in smart healthcare, PDT is still in its early stages. 
Therefore, this work aims to guide the design of industrial 
personalized healthcare systems by introducing a reference 
framework that brings together existing advanced 
technologies such as DTs, blockchain, and artificial 
intelligence to enable smart personalized healthcar e using 
PDTs. Several use cases are described, including the 
mitigation of COVID -19 contagion, follow -up care for 
COVID -19 survivors, personalized COVID -19 medicine, 
personalized osteoporosis prevention, personalized cancer 
survivor follow -up care, and per sonalized nutrition. Finally, 
the challenges that need to be addressed to move the PDT 
paradigm towards the smart personalized healthcare industry 
are identified [31]. 
Digital twins, virtual representations that are essentially a 
real-time digital version of a physical object or process, were 
first developed by NASA in 2010 to improve the simulation 
of spacecraft physical models. With the growth of the Internet 
of Things (IoT), digital twins have become more cost -
effective and have been succ essfully used in the 
manufacturing and service sectors to transform these 
industries. Given the benefits that digital twins have brought 
to these sectors, it is not surprising that they could potentially 
be used to bring similar benefits to the healthcare industry. 
This chapter discusses how and why digital twins could be 
conceptualized for healthcare [32]. 
Digital Twin (DT) is a technology that creates a digital 
replica of any physical phenomenon in a digital space, in sync 
with the physi cal state. However, creating a Healthcare DT 
model for patient care is seen as a challenging task due to the 
lack of a structured data collection system. There are also 
security and privacy concerns, as healthcare data is sensitive 
and can be misused. Give n these research gaps, it is important 
to find a way to properly acquire structured data and manage 
it securely. In this article, the authors present a mathematical 
data model to collect patient -relevant data in a structured and 
predefined way with clear b oundaries. They also describe the 
data model in the context of real -life scenarios. Then, they use 
the patient -centric mathematical data model to formally define 
the semantics and scope of our proposed Healthcare Digital 
Twin (HDT) system based on blockcha in technology. They 
describe the proposed system with all of its key components, 
as well as the detailed protocol flows and an analysis of its 
various aspects. Finally, they provide a feasibility analysis of 
the proposed model and compare it with other rel evant 
research works [33]. 
Ferdousi et al. provide an overview of well -being digital 
twins (WDT) in the healthcare industry, discussing their 
potential scope, architecture, and impact. They also discuss Aydin  and Karaarslan  
29 the definition and benefits of WDT, the evolution of digital 
twin frameworks, and the challenges, types, drawbacks, and 
potential application areas of WDT. Finally, the authors 
present the requirements for a WDT framework as identified 
in the literature  [34]. 
This study a ims to examine the potential and challenges of 
using digital twins, virtual representations of physical entities, 
to manage and predict outbreaks of Covid -19. By providing a 
detailed model of each patient, digital twins can be used to 
determine the most ef fective method of care for that 
individual, which can improve patient experience and care 
delivery and reduce demand on healthcare services. The 
review analyzed 18 papers that met the inclusion criteria and 
were published in English on the use of digital t wins in 
healthcare. However, none of the included papers specifically 
examined the use of digital twins in the context of Covid -19 
or infectious disease outbreaks. The review identified a need 
for more research on the use of digital twins in healthcare, 
particularly in the context of infectious disease outbreaks. The 
paper presents a preliminary conceptual framework for the use 
of digital twins in hospital management during the Covid -19 
outbreak to address this research gap  [35]. 
Electronic  Health Records (EHRs) have collected a large 
amount of data in recent years, but there is currently no 
comprehensive approach to using artificial intelligence to 
understand a patient's overall health. Digital Twin refers to a 
comprehensive physical and fu nctional representation of an 
item or system, including all relevant information for all life 
cycle phases. This paper presents a platform that uses 
advanced technologies such as Microservice Architecture 
(MSA), containerization (Docker), orchestration 
(Kubernetes), and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) to 
create a Digital Twin of Patient platform, inspired by 
Leonardo DaVinci's Vitruvian man. The platform's 
architecture includes clusters of Docker containers and 
Kubernetes orchestration to represent spec ific parts or organs 
of the body as "digital_twin_components," which come 
together to form the "patient_digital_twin" cluster. Pipelines 
are used to define and monitor the construction of the patient's 
digital twin in real time [36]. 
Digital twins, originally defined as virtual representations 
of physical assets, systems, or processes, have the potential to 
improve medical decision -making through the acquisition, 
management, analysis, prediction, and interpretation of data. 
However, there  are many challenges and barriers to using 
digital twins in healthcare. In this paper, the authors propose a 
dynamic digital twin approach to optimize individual patient 
healthcare journeys, specifically for women at risk for 
cardiovascular complications d uring preconception and 
pregnancy and throughout the lifespan. They discuss the 
potential for multiple domains to contribute to the 
development of this digital twin and outline future goals, 
trade -offs, and methods for guiding its development and 
implement ation in healthcare [37]. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) 
have improved smart city applications such as smart 
healthcare, transportation, and environmental management. 
Digital twins, which are AI -based virtual replicas of real -
world entities, have been adopted in manufacturing and 
industrial sectors but are still in the early stages of use in smart city applications due to concerns about trust and privacy in 
data sharing. Federated learning (FL), a technology th at 
preserves privacy and trustworthiness, could be used in 
conjunction with digital twins to improve adoption in real -
time and life -critical scenarios and facilitate governance in 
smart city applications. This paper presents a survey of the 
various smart c ity applications of FL models in digital twins, 
identifies challenges and future directions for improving FL -
digital twin integration in future applications [38]. 
Designing, constructing, and operating healthcare 
facilities is a complex proce ss in the 
architectural/engineering/construction (AEC) industry. 
Creating a systematic and transparent digital twin (DT) 
architecture with practical use cases would be an important 
first step in effectively managing these facilities. This study 
presents a DT system architecture specifically designed for 
healthcare facility management, with five layers: data 
acquisition, transmission, integrated middle platform, service, 
and target. The authors demonstrate how this architecture was 
used to develop a DT -based  smart ward in a Shanghai hospital, 
which integrates heterogeneous data sources to support real -
time data analysis and decision -making, improves healthcare 
service, and helps bridge the gap between humans and 
healthcare assets and spaces. The paper also ou tlines future 
directions and opportunities for DT -based healthcare facility 
management [39]. 
Digital twins, virtual representations of physical systems 
created using technologies such as Cyber -Physical Systems 
(CPS), the Internet of Things (I oT), Big Data, Edge 
Computing (EC), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine 
Learning (ML), have the potential to optimize a wide range of 
applications in industries such as healthcare and smart cities. 
However, digital twins are still in the early stages  of 
development. This paper provides an overview of the 
technologies used to create digital twins in industry and 
healthcare, including the characteristics of digital twins, 
communication technologies and tools, reference models, 
standards, and challenges and open issues. The authors also 
discuss their own recent work in the field of smart 
manufacturing and healthcare [40]. 
A digital twin is a virtual model designed to accurately 
reflect a physical object or system. In radiology, a digital t win 
of a radiological device can be used to test its characteristics, 
make changes to the design or materials, and assess the impact 
of those changes in a virtual environment. Innovative 
technologies such as artificial intelligence and -omics sciences 
may be used to create digital twins for patients that can be 
continually updated based on real -time health and lifestyle 
data. This could be used to improve personalized medicine. In 
addition, the creation of digital twins based on real -world 
deployments could  enable the use of large virtual patient 
populations for virtual clinical trials and population studies. 
Digital twins have the potential to transform how diseases are 
detected and managed, but there are still significant challenges 
to be addressed in thei r development. Radiologists can play a 
role in introducing digital twins into healthcare as this 
technology evolves [41]. 
Digital twins, virtual representations of physical assets 
such as devices, structures, and patients, are being explo red 
and applied in the healthcare industry. While much of the Aydin  and Karaarslan  
30 focus has been on creating digital twins as standalone 
applications, in reality, these assets are often interconnected 
and part of a larger physical ecosystem. In this article, the 
authors propo se the use of digital twins to create virtual 
representations of contexts and situations involving multiple 
related assets within a healthcare organization, resulting in an 
ecosystem of digital twins. They use trauma management as 
an example, but suggest t hat the concept could be applied to 
virtualize complex physical realities in a variety of contexts 
[42]. 
VI. FINDINGS AND RESULTS  
In the analysis made with the Ithenticate Plagiarism Tool, 
the similarity rate of the entire article (except the 
bibliography) was determined as 40%. This ratio occurs when 
the texts created by the authors and all the texts created by 
ChatGPT are evaluated. It is better to analyse the overall paper 
in three different sections:  
• Section A: The texts written by the paper 's authors  
• Section B:  The abstract texts of the article 
paraphrased by ChatGPT  
• Section C: The content generated by ChatGPT, 
which are answers to specific questions  
Section A had no noteworthy match, as seen in Figure 1. 
On the other hand, Section B showed a clear match, as seen in 
Figure 2. The check of Section C is shown in Figure 3. The 
matches of these texts are low, but still more than the Section 
A results.

VII. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION  
In this study, we first used ChatGPT to create texts for 
Digital Twin and Digital Twin in Healthcare titles. The 
literature review part of the article is created with these texts. 
The articles published from 2020 to 2022 were selected by 
searching Google Scholar with the keyword "Digital Twin in 
Healthcare". Then the abstracts of these studies were 
paraphrased with ChatGPT. Lat er on, we asked ChatGPT 
questions.  
In light of the findings and results, the plagiarism tool 
matching rates of the texts written by the study authors were 
very low. On the other hand, it was seen that the answers given 
by ChatGPT for the questions asked we re relatively low. On 
the contrary, the match rates of the abstract paraphrase tests 
created by ChatGPT are very high. From this information, it 
can be concluded that ChatGPT does not produce original 
texts after paraphrasing.  
This article is a beautiful a nd striking example of Artificial 
Intelligence to demonstrate the point it has reached. It seems 
possible for the academic literature to reach a different point 
with this and similar applications. The compilation and 
expression of knowledge will be acceler ated with the help of 
artificial intelligence, and these processes will require less 
human -driven procedures.  
In future work, citations to our study will be monitored. A new 
study will be put forward to evaluate the academic validity 
after we reach a high number (ex. 100) of citations to this 
study from journal articles. These citations will be grouped as 
positive, negative, or neutral. Then the evaluations of the 
article's adequacy will be considered. In this way, we will 
understand whether the academic co mmunity accepts the 
Aydin  and Karaarslan  
31 study we put forward. The contribution of this ChatGPT 
implementation to the academic literature will be analysed 
then.
