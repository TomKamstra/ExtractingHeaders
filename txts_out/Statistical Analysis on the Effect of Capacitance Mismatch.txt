This paper describes the statistical analysis of the effect of capacitance mismatch on the accuracy of a high-resolution
successive-approximation analog-to-digita l converter (ADC), which employs a split cap acitor array to achieve high resolution.
An analysis has been made for the following two types of capacito r digital-to-analog converters (DACs). One is the capacitor
DAC with binary-weighted capacitor array. The other is that whic h uses the segmented capacitor a rray for the upper bits to relax
the matching requirement. The analysis was veriﬁed using the Monte-Carlo simulation with capacitance mismatch. This analysis
clariﬁes the required capacitance matching for a given ADC re solution and provides with a guideline for the optimum design.

1. Introduction
The resolution of a successive-approximation (SAR) analog-
to-digital converter (ADC) that employs a capacitor digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is limite d by a capacitance mismatch. The
effect of the capacitance mismatch on the SAR ADC accuracy isanalyzed in Ref. [1]. However, it seems to be a little complexand is based on the maximum capacitance mismatch instead ofthe standard deviation. The required capacitance accuracy in theworst case is analyzed in Ref. [2] for the SAR ADC using a binary-weighted capacitor array. In this analysis, it is assumed that all theunit capacitors used for the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB) capacitorhave the maximum error in the same direction and the rest of theunit capacitors have the maximum error in the opposite direction.This assumption seems to be too tight. The data of the capacitancemismatch, which depend on the integrated circuit (IC) fabricationprocess, its structure and dimens ions, are usually available as a
statistical data, such as standard de viation [3, 4]. Therefore, it is
more practical to clarify the relationship between the standard
deviation of the capacitance mismatch and the achievable ADC
accuracy. In this paper, a statistical analysis has been made on theeffect of capacitance mismatch on the SAR ADC accuracy.
A SAR ADC basic conﬁguration is reviewed in Section 2 and
the statistical analysis is described in Section 3. The analyticalresults are compared with the Monte-Carlo simulation in Section 4and the results are summarized in Section 5.
2. SAR ADC Basic Conﬁguration
A block diagram of the SAR ADC employing a DAC capacitor
array is shown in Fig. 1. The input signal is sampled on thecapacitor array and then the DAC code that produces the samevoltage as the sampled input voltage is searched using the SARcontrol logic to complete the conversion.

Analog Devices K.K., 1-16-1 Kaigan Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-6891, JapanAn example of the DAC capacitor array for a high-resolution
SAR ADC is shown in Fig. 2(a). The capacitor array is split intotheM-bit main DAC array and the L-bit sub-DAC array to keep
the total capacitance in an achievable value to be integrated [2].These two arrays are connected with an attenuation capacitor to
form the N-bit ( N=M+L) capacitor DAC. A unit capacitance
(C)is used for the attenuation capacitor in order to keep good
capacitance matching. For a high-resolution ADC, a poly-polycapacitor or an metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor is usuallyused to have better capacitance matching and better linearity. Thecapacitance mismatch decreases as the capacitor size increases.The capacitor size is determined based on the required matchingto achieve the ADC resolution. The parasitic capacitance on bothside of the attenuation capacitor a lso causes a conversion error.
Employing a poly-poly capacitor or an MIM capacitor with smallerparasitic capacitance than other types of capacitors helps reducethe conversion error although a special care must be paid for
the layout. D

sub-DACs. VINandVRare the input and reference voltages. The

one in the main DAC dominates. In Section 3, the capacitancemismatch effect in the main DAC is analyzed.
3. Statistical Analysis on the Effect of Capacitance
Mismatch upon the SAR ADC Accuracy
In this section, the effect of the capacitance mismatch on the
ADC accuracy is analyzed for the following two cases. One is thecase where the main DAC consists of a binary-weighted capacitorarray. The other is the case where the segmented capacitor array isused for several upper bits of the main DAC to relax the matchingrequirement.
3.1. Case I: Binary-weighted capacitor array First,
the capacitance mismatch effect in the main DAC shown in Fig. 3is analyzed. This is the case where the binary-weighted capacitorarray is used. For simplicity, it is assumed that all sub-DACcapacitors are connected to the ground and the initial chargeis zero. The maximum error occurs during the code transitionfrom ‘011 ...1’ to ‘100 ...0’ at the midpoint where the number of
capacitors that change their state is maximal as shown in Fig. 3(a).To meet the ADC accuracy, this error must be smaller than a halfleast signiﬁcant bit (LSB) (V
R/2(N+1)). The capacitor arrangement
for this code transition is shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c).
VXis the voltage at node A before the code transition and VX/prime
is that after the transition. Before the code transition, the MSB
capacitor in the main DAC and all capacitors in the sub-DAC areconnected to the ground, and all other capacitors are connected tothe reference as shown in Fig. 3(b). Using (1), V
Xis given by
VX≈(2M−1−1)C
2M(1–2−N)CVR≈(2M−1−1)C
2MCVR (9)
After the code transition, the MSB capacitor in the main DAC is
connected to the reference, and all other capacitors are connectedto the ground as shown in the ﬁgure. Due to the code transition,the charge on node A is redistributed to each capacitor and theresulting voltage ( V

However, the mismatch in the capacitor array causes an error.
It is assumed that a unit capacitor ( C)is given by
C=CU+/Delta1CU (12)
where CUis the average unit capacitance, and /Delta1CUis the standard
deviation. Each capacitor in the array consists of unit capacitors
connected in parallel. When the number of unit capacitor connectedin parallel is N
C, the average of the total capacitance is NCCU,
whereas the standard deviation is√NC/Delta1CU, assuming that they
are not correlated. From (9), (10) and (12), the standard deviation
of (V/prime

since the terms in the numerator are statistical data. To achieve
the ADC accuracy, αtimes VDNL,STD must be smaller than a half
LSB of the N-bit ADC ( VR/2N+1). This results in
/Delta1CU
CU<1

2M−1(15)
As a practical value, α=3.3 is often used [5]. When the ADC
resolution is 14 bits (N =14) and the main DAC resolution is 7
bits (M =7), the standard deviation o f the capacitance mismatch
must be smaller than 0.011% with α=3.3.
The relationship between the standard deviation of the accept-
able capacitance mismatch and the main DAC resolution (M) isshown in Fig. 4, for the ADC resolution of 14 bits ( N=14).
Accordingly, the sub-sub DAC has L(=14−M)bits. This graph
is based on (15). The total capac itance including the main and
sub-sub DACs is (2
M−1)C+214−MCin the case where the
binary-weighted capacitor array is used in both main and sub-subDACs. The total capacitance normalized by the unit capacitanceis also shown in Fig. 4. The main DAC capacitance dominateswith large M, whereas the sub-sub DAC capacitance dominates
with small M. As can be seen in the ﬁgure, the acceptable mis-
match increases with Mand becomes maximal with M=14.As
the practical unit capacitance is often around 100 fF; however,the total capacitance becomes 1600 pF with M=14.This capaci-
tance is too large to be integrated. There is a trade-off between therequired accuracy and the total capacitance. When the main DAC
resolution is reduced to 7 bits ( M=7), the total capacitance is
reduced to about 26 pF, which is a practical value to be integratedat the expense of tighter matching requirement.0200400600800100012001400160018002000

Since sometimes the required accuracy of the MSB capacitance
(CMSB)is argued, it would be worthwhile to show how it is related
to the mismatch in a unit capacitance. The percentage of themismatch of this capacitance i s much smaller than that of the
unit capacitance as shown below because it consists of 2
M−1unit
capacitors connected in parallel.

In the case of M=7, the mismatch of the MSB capacitance
is eight times smaller than that o f the unit capacitance. Although
this requirement seems to be ver y tight, it is equivalent to the
requirement given by (15) as shown here.
Next, the integral nonlinearity (INL) is analyzed. The INL is
deﬁned as a departure from the line that goes through two end
points where the codes are all 0s and all 1s. Although the capac-itance mismatch is accumulated, the voltage at node A is equal to
(1–2
−M)VRwhen the code is all 1 because all capacitors are con-
nected to the reference. This results in the ideal voltage of VR/2 at
the midpoint. The INL becomes maximal at the midpoint due to theaccumulation of the capacitance mismatch. Referring to (10), thestandard deviation of t he INL error voltage, V

In comparison with (14), the INL is about√
2 times smaller
than the differential nonlinearity (DNL) in this case. Even with
the segmented capacitor array or the mixture of the segmented
and binary-weighted capacitor arrays which is described later, theINL becomes maximal at the midpoint because the departure fromthe ideal line due to the accumulation of the mismatch becomes
maximal at that point. Therefore, the INL in these cases is also
given by (19). The DNL is usually required to be less than a half
LSB and at least one LSB to avoid a missing code. In contrast, theINL requirement could be less critical than the DNL depending on
the application. To keep the INL error small, the focus must also be
on the layout to reduce the effect of oxide thickness gradient [2].The DNL for the other type of capacitor array is analyzed in thefollowing section.
3.2. Case II: Segmented capacitor array for upper
bits The required capacitance mis match can be relaxed using
S91 IEEJ Trans 6(S1): S89–S93 (2011)T. WAKIMOTO, H. LI AND K. MURASE
a segmented capacitor array as shown in Fig. 5(a) as the number
of capacitors to be switched at the same time is reduced. In this
case, the segmented capacitor array is used for the upper 5 bits and
the binary-weighted capacitor array is used for the lower 2 bits.
In this conﬁguration, the maximum error occurs during the code
transition from ‘00 ...0011’ to ‘00 ...0100’ because the number of
capacitors that change their state is maximal during this transition.
The capacitor array before and after the code transition is shown
in Fig. 5(b) and (c).
In Fig. 5(b), 2 binary-weighted capacitors are connected to the
reference and all other capacitors are connected to the ground. In
Fig. 5(c), one of the 31 segmented capacitors are connected to the
reference, and all other capacitors are connected to the ground.

The required standard deviatio n of the capacitance mismatch is

the required matching is 4.1 times relaxed. However, a segmented
capacitor array requires much mor e digital control signals than a
binary-weighted one, although the t otal capacitance is the same.
For example, a 7-bit segmented capacitor array requires 127
(=27−1) control signals, whereas a 7 -bit binary-weighted array

requires only 7. Therefore, the combination of these capacitor
arrays is usually used to reduc e the number of control signals
based on the trade-offs between the required capacitance matchingand the complexity of signal routing in the IC layout. In the
case in Fig. 5(a), the number of t he required control signals is
33 (=2+2
5−1).
A more generalized case of the capacitor array in Fig. 5(a)
is shown in Fig. 6(a). Here, the upper Kbits consist of a
segmented capacitor array, whereas the lower ( M−K)bits consist
of a binary-weighted capacitor array. In this conﬁguration, the
maximum error occurs during the code transition where the binary
capacitor array changes its state from all 1s to all 0s becausethe number of capacitors that change the state is maximal. Thecapacitor array before and after the code transition is shown in
Fig. 6(b) and (c). Similar to the previous case, the voltage at node

This is a more generalized expression of the case in Fig. 5.
When N=14,M=7a n d K=5, the standard deviation of the
capacitance mismatch must be s maller than 0.045%. This is the
same result as with the case shown in Fig. 5 as expected because
the condition is the same.
4. Simulation Results
To verify the analysis of the capacitance mismatch effect on the
SAR ADC accuracy, the analyzed value was compared with the
S92 IEEJ Trans 6(S1): S89–S93 (2011)STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECT OF CAPACITANCE MISMATCH
Monte-Carlo simulation results. In simulation it was assumed that
the unit capacitance has a Gaussian distribution and 1000 trials
were carried out. The results for the binary-weighted capacitor
array in Fig. 3 are shown in Fig. 7. This shows the relationship
between the required capacitance matching and the main DACresolution for each ADC resolution. The solid lines show the value
calculated using (15) and the dots show the values obtained from
the Monte-Carlo simulation. The simulation results agree withthe analytical results fairly well. As the main DAC resolution
increases, the required capacitance accuracy is relaxed at the
expense of increased total capacitance. When the ADC resolution
is 14 bits and the main DAC resolution is 7 bits, the acceptable
capacitance mismatch is 0.011% with α=3.3.
The simulation results for the case where the main DAC
resolution is 7 bits and the segmented capacitor array was used
for the upper Kbits are shown in Fig. 8. The solid line shows the
value calculated using (27) and the dots show the value obtained
from Monte-Carlo simulation. Simulation results agree with the
analyzed value as shown in the ﬁgure. As the number of segmented
capacitors increases, the required capacitance matching is relaxed
because the number of capacitors whose states change reduces.As mentioned in the previous section, this results in increased
control signals. Therefore, the optimum segmented capacitor array
needs to be determined based on this trade-off. In the case wherethe ADC resolution is 14 bits, the main DAC resolution is 7 bits
and the upper 5 bits are segmented, the standard deviation of the
acceptable capacitance mismatch is 0.045% with α=3.3.
The discussion so far is for the single-ended case. In the case
of the differential conﬁguration with two sets of capacitor arrays,the capacitance matching requirement is√

5. Conclusions
The required capacitance matching to achieve a high-resolution
SAR ADC was analyzed. Statistical analysis was made for theinternal DACs with the binary-weighted capacitor array and amixture of the segmented and binary-weighted capacitor arrays.
The latter case relaxes the capacitance matching requirement for
the DNL at the expense of the increased complexity of signalrouting in the layout. The analytical results were veriﬁed bycomparing with the Monte-Carlo simulation results, and providewith a clear trade-off between the standard deviation of the
capacitance mismatch and an achievable ADC resolution.
